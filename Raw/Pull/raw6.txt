What\r\n\r\n* Fix `next/dynamic` with babel config and `src/` directory\r\n* Separate the existing `next/dynamic` dev tests, make it easier to cover more cases, add `.babelrc` + `src/` folder coverage case\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\n* The new transform is using `src/` or root dir as the base directory `next/dynamic` for generating relative module path as unique key for `next/dynamic` modules. The babel one was always using the root dir (`cwd`), which is incorrect.

next/dynamic with babel and src dir (#65177)","commit_message":"### What\r\n\r\n* Fix `next/dynamic` with babel config and `src/` directory\r\n* Separate the existing `next/dynamic` dev tests, make it easier to\r\ncover more cases, add `.babelrc` + `src/` folder coverage case\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\n* The new transform is using `src/` or root dir as the base directory\r\n`next/dynamic` for generating

What?\r\n\r\nEnsures just importing `crypto` does not error, only when it is used it shows an error in the edge runtime. This matches webpack behavior. The `crypto` module was missing the list of unsupported packages in the Next.js Turbopack integration.\r\n\r\nFixes #64464\r\nFixes PACK-2954\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhile adding tests for this issue I found another bug that only happens with webpack. \r\n\r\nSpecifically these 4 packages are accidentally being polyfilled even when they're not set up to be polyfilled. i.e. there's no npm package installed for polyfilling them through aliasing or such. Even in that case `punycode`, `process`, `querystring`, and `string_decorder` get polyfilled regardless, this causes the newly added test to fail.\r\n\r\nRemoving the polyfills would be potentially breaking so we'll want to change it in Next.js 15 instead.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What\r\nWhen a page throws a `notFound()` error in `generateMetadata`, and the page contains parallel route(s), an unhandled runtime error would be thrown rather than displaying the not found page.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWe use the `<MetadataOutlet />` component to throw any errors caught during metadata resolution once the metadata is rendered by React so that it can be caught by an error boundary, so that it doesn't throw during metadata resolution. A promise is tracked & resolved with an error once the metadata tree is rendered. Once the promise resolves, the outlet component will throw. \r\n\r\nHowever, every `__PAGE__` segment that would be rendered as part of the page the user is on will render this `<MetadataOutlet />` component. We only need a single outlet per segment as only a single error needs to be thrown & caught. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis will only render a `MetadataOutlet` for the first parallel route that is encountered at each segment depth, as we only need a single handler to throw the error. \r\n\r\nFixes #65013\r\nCloses

common pattern for parallel routes is breadcrumbs. For example, if I have a lot of dynamic pages, and I want to render a parallel route that renders as a breadcrumb to enumerate those dynamic params, intuitively I'd reach for something like `app/@slot/[...allTheThings]/page.tsx`. Currently however, `[...allTheThings]` would only match params to a corresponding `app/[allTheThings]/page.tsx`. This makes it difficult to build the breadcrumbs use-case unless you re-create every single dynamic page in the parallel route as well. \r\n\r\nThis adds handling to provide unmatched catch-all routes with all of the params that are known. For example, if I was on `/app/[artist]/[album]/[track]`, and I visited `/zack/greatest-hits/1`, the parallel `@slot` params would receive: `{ allTheThings: ['zack', 'greatest-hits', '1']

base: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/actions/runs/8927220553/job/24520090130?pr=65281\r\n\r\nThe biggest change to our implementation is implementing the fetch patch that was removed from React: [`b59541d` (#65058)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65058/commits/b59541debe6dd0fdb1472a99bb3aff770a6c111d)\r\n\r\n`<Head>` currently duplicates tags on the first client-side navigation. Looking into this before I land this.\r\n\r\n## Notable changes\r\n\r\nBetter hydration diffs: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65276\r\n\r\n## React changes that affect our test suite\r\n\r\naa503da67032db58555ff20cf3fb9df1addded73\r\n`React.cache` no longer works in client components\r\n\r\nb6393d02ea5c57b04bbb0ceb52a6b09c36d97a26\r\n(Known bug) Effects are currently not double invoked in `StrictMode` during hydration. We already experienced this in PPR tests but not because of PPR but because these tests were using React's experimental build\r\n\r\nDue to React Float, the loose reconciler for `Head` children (default) can loose track of `<script>` and cause re-execution. We already warn on `Head > script`. This can also be fixed by enabling `experimental.strictNextHead`.\r\n\r\n## BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n3d3b012257d1fe07b4704c825165b180a5632b6a\r\n`next/legacy/image` now relies on React server-side rendering to add `<link rel=\"preload\" />` to the `body` instead of `head`. React will take the attributes of the first `<img />` whereas `next/legacy/image` took the attributes of the last `<img />` with the same key. For example, `<img crossOrigin=\"use-credentials\" href=\"foo.png\" /><img crossOrigin=\"\" href=\"foo.png\" />` used to result in the image being preloaded with cross-origin set to anonymous. Now it would use `use-credentials` since that was specified in the first image.\r\n\r\n533827f6c5c4a728ae425d39327ba47bec1ce879\r\nWhen AMP is used, custom scripts (e.g. `<script />`) now fail AMP validation i.e. fail the build. They used to be removed without any validation error. \r\n\r\nPages router requires React version `19.0.0-beta-4508873393-20240430`.

including `page.js` in the size calculation isn't enough since it may require other chunks.\r\n\r\nIn a Webpack world we'd use the Webpack stats instead for accurate calculations without having to read from the filesystem. Turbopack doesn't have these available so we just read every file listed in the the `files` entry for that specific route in the middleware manifest.\r\n\r\nI know not enough about all these manifest to be able to generalize this so for now this only works for the edge-ssr calculation which regressed in https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64798 but wasn't caught since the significant bundle

What\r\n\r\nSupport `esmExternals` working in app router\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\n`esmExternals` was disabled for app router that most of the packages are picking up the CJS bundles for externals. This PR enables to resolve the ESM bundle for external packages.\r\n\r\nWe have two issues discovered while enabling the flag, any esm external packages will fail in client page SSR and server action. We fixed them by changing the below bundling logics:\r\n\r\n* When a client page having a async dependency, we can await the page during in rendering\r\n* When a server action having a async

`unstable_after`, which lets the user schedule work to be executed after the response is finished.\r\n\r\n### Implementation notes\r\n\r\n- `unstable_after()` is a dynamic function (bypassable only with `export dynamic = \"force-static\"`)\r\n- Usable in: server components (including `generateMetadata`), actions, route handlers, middleware\r\n- It is meant to run its callbacks even if a response didn't complete successfully (thrown error) or called `notFound()`/`redirect()`\r\n- Currently gated behind a `experimental.after` feature flag, because it touches many runtime bits (including a React monkeypatch...)\r\n- The state for `unstable_after()` in a given request lives in `requestAsyncStorage` (added via `RequestAsyncStorageWrapper`)\r\n\r\n- the implementation is based around two functions that we inject via `renderOpts`:\r\n  - `waitUntil(promise)` - keep a function invocation alive until a promise settles. it is provided as a platform primitive in serverless contexts, and a noop in `next start`\r\n    - for serverless (nodejs), Next.js will attempt to get `waitUntil` from `globalThis[Symbol.for('@next/request-context')].get().waitUntil`. This should be considered unstable for now.

unstable_after (#65038)","commit_message":"Implements `unstable_after`, which lets the user schedule work to be\r\nexecuted after the response is finished.\r\n\r\n### Implementation notes\r\n\r\n- `unstable_after()` is a dynamic function (bypassable only with `export\r\ndynamic = \"force-static\"`)\r\n- Usable in: server components (including `generateMetadata`), actions,\r\nroute handlers, middleware\r\n- It is meant to run its callbacks even if a response didn't complete\r\nsuccessfully (thrown error) or called `notFound()`/`redirect()`\r\n- Currently gated behind a `experimental.after` feature flag, because it\r\ntouches many runtime bits (including a React monkeypatch...)\r\n- The state for `unstable_after()` in a given request lives in\r\n`requestAsyncStorage` (added via `RequestAsyncStorageWrapper`)\r\n\r\n- the implementation is based around two functions that we inject via\r\n`renderOpts`:\r\n- `waitUntil(promise)` - keep a function invocation alive until a\r\npromise settles. it is provided as a platform primitive in serverless\r\ncontexts, and a noop in `next start`\r\n- for serverless (nodejs), Next.js will attempt to get `waitUntil` from\r\n`globalThis[Symbol.for('@next/request-context')].get().waitUntil`. This\r\nshould be considered unstable for now. See\r\n`packages/next/src/server/after/wait-until-builtin.ts` for details.\r\n- `onClose(callback)` **[NEW]** - run something when a response is done.\r\nbasically `res.on('close', callback)`, but also implemented for Web APIs\r\n- unfortunately, for Web, this requires some potentially expensive\r\ntricks - see `packages/next/src/server/web/web-on-close.ts`"},"active_lock_reason":"resolved"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65029","id":1840332238,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5tsT3O","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65029","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65029.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65029.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65029","number":65029,"state":"closed","locked":true,"title":"Fix Server Action closure example","user":{"login":"lukahartwig","id":7414521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTQ1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7414521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig","html_url":"https://github.com/lukahartwig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukahartwig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes

What?\r\n\r\nCorrects the Bun install command (again) on [this page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app#interactive) of the docs.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe Bun instructions were originally created in 7e165384857893a25eb59b800c5af585a7778c71 with a correct command to create a new Next.js project with Bun: `bunx create-next-app`.\r\n\r\nThen, it was changed to `bunx create next-app` in 2ab4a443a20d3f8b977c18b94c93f23d4cecb413, which isn't correct because `bunx` acts like `npx` and tries to run a nonexistent package called `create`, specifying `next-app` as its argument.\r\n\r\nThis change was reverted in a42efae49db1d4302f4b0b5e07f9ee45742b0d95 two weeks ago, and a PR from today (#64972) reverts that correction.\r\n\r\nBoth `bunx create-next-app` and `bun create next-app` work on my machine as of Bun 1.0. `bunx create-next-app` is analogous to `npx create-next-app`, and `bun create next-app` is the same as `npm create next-app`.\r\n\r\n| Command | Correct? | Similar NPM command | Note |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| `bun create next-app` | :white_check_mark: | `npm create next-app` | My proposed change |\r\n| `bunx create-next-app` | :white_check_mark: | `npx create-next-app` | |\r\n| `bunx create next-app` | :x: | `npx create next-app` (incorrect) | Currently listed in the Next.js docs |\r\n| `bun create-next-app` | :x: | `npm create-next-app` (incorrect) | |\r\n\r\nI think this confusion is caused by having two valid ways to run `create-next-app` with two very similar syntaxes. **It could be beneficial to include a note explaining the two correct syntaxes** to avoid future confusion, but for now, I have just changed `bunx` -> `bun` to keep the command similar to `yarn` and `pnpm`.","created_at":"2024-04-25T01:51:50Z","updated_at":"2024-05-10T00:05:02Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T04:03:12Z","merged_at":"2024-04-25T04:03:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d4dc4b5f9a0dd9bfb8148f4c736fb11f3299ec6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"molebox","id":22930449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTMwNDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22930449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox","html_url":"https://github.com/molebox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molebox/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"delbaoliveira","id":32464864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDY0ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32464864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira","html_url":"https://github.com/delbaoliveira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3644980154,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis7ZQfu6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/Documentation","name":"Documentation","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Related

fix Bun install command (#65016)","commit_message":"### What?\r\n\r\nCorrects the Bun install command (again) on [this\r\npage](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app#interactive)\r\nof the docs.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe Bun instructions were originally created in\r\n7e165384857893a25eb59b800c5af585a7778c71 with a correct command to\r\ncreate a new Next.js project with Bun: `bunx create-next-app`.\r\n\r\nThen, it was changed to `bunx create next-app` in\r\n2ab4a443a20d3f8b977c18b94c93f23d4cecb413, which isn't correct because\r\n`bunx` acts like `npx` and tries to run a nonexistent package called\r\n`create`, specifying `next-app` as its argument.\r\n\r\nThis change was reverted in a42efae49db1d4302f4b0b5e07f9ee45742b0d95 two\r\nweeks ago, and a PR from today (#64972) reverts that correction.\r\n\r\nBoth `bunx create-next-app` and `bun create next-app` work on my machine\r\nas of Bun 1.0. `bunx create-next-app` is analogous to `npx\r\ncreate-next-app`, and `bun create next-app` is the same as `npm create\r\nnext-app`.\r\n\r\n| Command | Correct? | Similar NPM command | Note |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| `bun create next-app` | :white_check_mark: | `npm create next-app` |\r\nMy proposed change |\r\n| `bunx create-next-app` | :white_check_mark: | `npx create-next-app` |\r\n|\r\n| `bunx create next-app` | :x: | `npx create next-app` (incorrect) |\r\nCurrently listed in the Next.js docs |\r\n| `bun create-next-app` | :x: | `npm create-next-app` (incorrect) | |\r\n\r\nI think this confusion is caused by having two valid ways to run\r\n`create-next-app` with two very similar syntaxes. **It could be\r\nbeneficial to include a note explaining the two correct syntaxes** to\r\navoid future confusion, but for now, I have just changed `bunx` -> `bun`\r\nto keep the command similar to `yarn` and `pnpm`.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Sam Ko

If a user calls `fetch` from within a `unstable_cache` callback with `cache: \"no-store\"`, we currently break out, as that fetch operation is called within a cached callback.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nWithout this change, using `unstable_cache` would have limited affect when dealing with external code that explicitly sets `cache: \"no-store\"` preventing it from utilizing the user-specified-cache.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThis modifies the fetch patching so it doesn't bail static rendering due to dynamic fetches within an `unstable_cache` callback.\r\n\r\nCloses

If a\r\nuser calls `fetch` from within a `unstable_cache` callback with `cache:\r\n\"no-store\"`, we currently break out, as that fetch operation is called\r\nwithin a cached callback.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nWithout this change, using `unstable_cache` would have limited affect\r\nwhen dealing with external code that explicitly sets `cache: \"no-store\"`\r\npreventing it from utilizing the user-specified-cache.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThis modifies the fetch patching so it doesn't bail static rendering due\r\nto dynamic fetches within an `unstable_cache` callback.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-3220"},"active_lock_reason":"resolved"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65008","id":1839727725,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5tqARt","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65008","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65008.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65008.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65008","number":65008,"state":"closed","locked":true,"title":"initialize ALS with cookies in middleware","user":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"### What\r\nCookies set/updated/removed in middleware won't be accessible during the render in which they were set\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nMiddleware will properly set a `set-cookie` header to inform the client of the cookie change, but this means the `AsyncLocalStorage` context containing the cookies value wouldn't be updated until the next time the request headers were parsed. In other words, on the first request the cookie would be sent but wouldn't be available in the `cookies()` context. And then the following request would properly have the cookie values.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis uses a proxy on the `ResponseCookies` used in middleware to add a middleware override header with the cookie value. When we instantiate the cached cookies, we merge in whatever headers would have been set by middleware, so that they're available in the same render that invoked middleware. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThis changeset adds a test to confirm cookies set/deleted in middleware are available in a single pass. Verified with a deployment [here](https://vtest314-e2e-tests-ldx7olfl1-ztanner.vercel.app/rsc-cookies).\r\n\r\nFixes #49442\r\nCloses

What\r\n\r\nIn case of socket raises errors and there aren't any listener to handle it, node.js exits with non-0 exit code. So even test passes with all assertion if socket raises an error while teardown (i.e socket destroyed due to server process killed by test teardown) test will fail.\r\n\r\nPR adjusts fixture setup by wiring empty error handler to write console message to avoid those. If test assertion fails due to legit socket error, we'll see error message. Otherwise we consider socket error is not related with test.\r\n\r\n- Closes

Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\nPreviously, parsing and managing the `NODE_OPTIONS` was performed using a series of regular expressions. These were prone to bugs, and have already caused a few issues. This moves us over to the standard `parseArgs` ([docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/util.html#utilparseargsconfig)):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { parseArgs } from \"node:utils\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the argument parser dramatically, removing the need for any special patterns or accommodations. No need to maintain all these patterns when there's a lightweight built-in parser already available.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/53127\r\nFixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/53757\r\nFixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/47083\r\nFixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/50489\r\nCloses

appears that it has not completely resolved\r\nthe issue with CodeSandbox caching lockfiles and using an outdated\r\nversion of Next.js\r\n\r\nEg. currently, the reproduction template URL uses `next@14.2.0-canary.9`\r\nis not the latest canary\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template\r\n\r\n<img\r\nsrc=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/1935696/61b5cffa-90d2-4843-aaec-32e6f1e100e8\r\nwidth=560>\r\n\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the following changes to the reproduction template to\r\ninstall the latest version on fork:\r\n\r\n1. On CodeSandbox \"dev\" task start, always update to latest Next.js with\r\n`pnpm update next`\r\n2. Make the CodeSandbox \"dev\" task restart on fork / clone of the\r\nsandbox (@CompuIves built this feature very recently)\r\n\r\nObserve how the `pnpm update next` script at the start of the `dev` task\r\nruns again when forking my branch of the reproduction example:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/1935696/a3f6e65c-02cb-4eac-b0fa-367ac1751c39\r\n\r\ncc @samcx @styfle

What\r\nThe \"auto\" prefetching behavior differs between dev/prod, resulting in confusing DX when configuring `experimental.staleTimes = { static: 0, dynamic: 0 }`.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nPrefetching is intentionally disabled in dev, but we still will create an \"auto\" prefetch on navigation. When configuring `experimental.staleTimes` to have a `0` value in both static/dynamic cases (a pattern that isn't a good idea, but should still have consistent DX), it means that any auto prefetching that happens is effectively discarded immediately, as we also would also not be able to re-use the loading data.\r\n\r\nIn prod, we would have created a \"temporary\" prefetch for this case, which is effectively not a prefetch at all and gets the full RSC data. However in dev, we've special-cased these prefetches to be \"auto\", so the client won't ever receive fresh data after the first time the cache is seeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis removes the special-handling for dev to instead be similar to other prefetches that are created ad-hoc, and marks it as a \"temporary\" prefetch kind. This has the added benefit of not triggering 2 separate RSC calls in dev when only one is really needed. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nClient cache tests were previously disabled in dev because caching behavior does intentionally differ between dev/prod. But we can at the very least assert that the \"auto\" prefetching behavior is consistent between the two environments, so that's what has been added to the tests here.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a test for the `experimental.staleTimes = { static: 0, dynamic: 0 }` case. \r\n\r\nx-ref: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/54075#discussioncomment-9202650\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

currently have logic spread in multiple places that normalize `nxtP` parameters into their regular names, ie `nxtPfoo` -> `foo`. However we don't apply this same logic to `nxtI`, which conceptually is another parameter but for route interception. As a result, the interception route would 404 when deployed because it'd be missing the interception parameter.\r\n\r\nThis moves the normalization check into a util and updates the spots I could find where we handle `nxtP` to also handle `nxtI`.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nAdded a new test, and validated via these deploys:\r\n\r\n**Working**:

What?\r\n\r\nUpdated the example `with-storybook`, by upgrading storybook to version 8.0.9 (the latest) which required bumping the version of next.js to 14 from 13 in order to make them work together. \r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is that we now have better the lastest features of storybook such as chromatic and visual testing. As of previous updates, it is still treated as its own framework and so users can specify the `storybook` framework as well as custom build command `build-storybook` in order to get near zero-config

What?\r\n\r\nBefore: 25.71s\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-04-23 at 12 19 42@2x](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/6324199/3a0ebb81-ac55-4b0c-8bfc-9a61ce138e6f)\r\n\r\nAfter: 11.05s (-57%)\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-04-23 at 12 16 35@2x](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/6324199/d7b6cd4c-d1e4-4dc2-a423-20b539186d25)\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\nCurrently the system for isolation looks like this:\r\n\r\n- Copy `packages` folder to an isolated directory\r\n- Run `pnpm pack` for all folders in `packages`\r\n- Collect the pack files, add them as `dependencies` in package.json of the isolated application\r\n- Run `pnpm install`\r\n\r\nBecause the `next-swc` (Turbopack + SWC, yes we still need to rename the package) binary file is quite large in development (900MB+) it means we have to copy, then zip (pnpm pack), then unzip (pnpm install) that binary, which takes about 3+ seconds in each step.\r\n\r\nThe change in this PR is to skip the copy/zip/unzip completely by providing the folder path for the binary directly to Next.js, as it's a binary we don't need the special isolation for this, it's already standalone so running it directly allows us to skip 14,6 seconds of work that is required for each isolated test in development.\r\n\r\nThis will likely have little effect on CI times as we already do some tricks like only running the packing at the start of the CI process. Only thing that could be better and is probably worth doing is adopting this change for the time it saves for unzipping, that's almost 4 seconds per test still.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What\r\n\r\n* Remove the change added in #64467, but still kept tests.\r\n* Add more tests for mixed imports (component and function) from shared component with `optimizePackageImports`\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nThe fix in #64467 was not correct, as mixing `export *` with `\"use client\"` should error if Next.js detect it properly.\r\nWhen there's mixed exports, that a shared function will become a client reference if the target file inherits the client boundary.\r\n\r\nThe original issue #64467 fixed was actually related to tree-shaking, which is fixed in #64681. \n\nCloses
