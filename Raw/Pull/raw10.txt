#64005\r\n\r\n### What ?\r\n\r\n#60630 added\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// unstable_noStore.ts\r\nstaticGenerationStore.isUnstableNoStore = true;\r\n\r\n// patch-fetch.ts\r\nif (isUsingNoStore) {\r\n  revalidate = 0;\r\n  cacheReason = 'noStore call';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ntry to fix `cache reason for using fetch with noStore` , however , With PPR enabled ,it may cause some unexpected problems.\r\n\r\n### Why ?\r\n\r\nCurrent condition: `fetchCacheMode !== 'default-cache'  || fetchCacheMode !== 'default-no-store'   ||  autoNoCache !== true `\r\n\r\nE.g. Fetching data with `revalidate = undefined`, the result is expect to be  static and `revalidate = false`\r\n\r\nFor the `Store` is shared by the path( not sure about that ) , \r\n\r\nSetting `unstable_noStore = true` and `revalidate = 0`  will affect all subsequent ( satisfying the current condition)  `fetch` request.\r\n\r\nIn fact, our goal is to set `revalidate` to `0` for all fetch requests within the suspense boundary after  `noStore()`  is called.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### How ?\r\n\r\nAfter calling `noStore()`, subsequent Fetch calls will not be invoked, indicating that

What\r\nWhen triggering an interception route that has a parent with dynamic params, and then later going to \"refresh\" the tree, either by calling `router.refresh` or revalidating in a server action, the refresh action would silently fail and the router would be in a bad state.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nBecause of the dependency that interception routes currently have on `FlightRouterState` for dynamic params extraction, we need to make sure the refetch has the full tree so that it can properly extract earlier params. Since the refreshing logic traversed parallel routes and scoped the refresh to that particular segment, it would skip over earlier segments, and so when the server attempted to diff the tree, it would return an updated tree that corresponded with the wrong segment (`[locale]` rather than `[\"locale\", \"en\", \"d]`).\r\n\r\nSeparately, since a page segment might be `__PAGE__?{\"locale\": \"en\"}` rather than just `__PAGE__`, this updates the refetch marker logic to do a partial match on the page segment key. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis keeps a reference to the root of the updated tree so that the refresh always starts at the top. This has the side effect of re-rendering more data when making the \"stale\" refetch request, but this is necessary until we can decouple `FlightRouterState` from interception routes. \r\n\r\nshout-out to @steve-marmalade for helping find this bug and providing excellent Replays to help track it down 🙏 \r\n\r\nx-ref:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/63900\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

have some meta information on requests so we can identify if a request belongs to a route so we can terminate logging early.\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2977, closes

What & Why\r\nThere was some code added in the catch-all route normalization that doesn't seem to make sense -- it was checking if the provided `appPath` depth was larger than the catch-all route depth, prior to inserting it. But it was comparing depths in an inconsistent way (`.length` vs `.length - 1`), and the catch all path was also considering the `@slot` and `/page` suffix as part of the path depth.  \r\n\r\nThis means that if you had a `@modal/[...catchAll]` slot, it wouldn't be considered for a page like `/foo/bar/baz`, because `/foo/bar/baz` (depth: 4 with the current logic) and `/@modal/[...catchAll]/page` (depth: 3 with the current logic) signaled that the `/foo/bar/baz` route was \"more specific\" and shouldn't match the catch-all.\r\n\r\nI think this was most likely added to resolve a bug where we were inserting optional catch-all (`[[...catchAll]]`) routes into parallel slots. However, optional catch-all routes are currently unsupported with parallel routes, so this feature didn't work properly and the partial support introduced a bug for regular catch-all routes. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis removes the confusing workaround and skips optional catch-all segments in this handling. Separately, we can add support for optional catch-all parallel routes, but doing so will require quite a bit more changes & also similar handling in Turbopack. Namely, if have a top-level optional catch-all, in both the Turbopack & current Webpack implementation, that top-level catch-all wouldn't be matched. And if you tried to have an optional catch-all slot, in both implementations, the app would error with: \r\n> You cannot define a route with the same specificity as a optional catch-all route (\"/\" and \"/[[...catchAll]]\")\r\n\r\nbecause our route normalization logic does not treat slots specificity differently than pages. \r\n\r\n**Note**: This keeps the test that was added when this logic was first introduced in #60776 to ensure that the case this was originally added for still passes. \r\n\r\nFixes #62948\r\nCloses

Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nFixes #63871\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\nAdds safe traversal to rewrite `has` items in a certain new (`isInterceptionRouteRewrite()` added in the v14.2.0 canaries) check to the rewrite routes.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe new check assumed that all `has` arrays had at least one item, when previously Next.js accepted rewrites with empty `has`. Adding safe traversal doesn't negatively impact the check, as the check only needs rewrites with the first item.\r\n\r\nFixes #63871\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-29T18:19:20Z","updated_at":"2024-04-13T12:01:57Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T23:38:06Z","merged_at":"2024-03-29T23:38:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"5cfb7a087845ad1e0d0a0943ad4dd2342f0d81ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wy

PR adds a `--experimental-debug-memory-usage` flag to `next build` to make it easier to debug memory performance. This mode does the following things:\r\n\r\n- Periodically prints the current memory usage of the process\r\n- Records garbage collection events and warns about long running GC events\r\n- Kills the process if it detects GC thrashing near heap limit\r\n- Automatically takes a heap snapshot if heap usage rises above 70% of the total heap\r\n- Automatically takes a heap snapshot if the process is close to running out of memory\r\n- Prints a report at the end of the build with information about peak memory usage and time spent in garbage collection","created_at":"2024-03-29T17:03:20Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T12:03:40Z","closed_at":"2024-04-09T13:53:34Z","merged_at":"2024-04-09T13:53:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"a01f82559237b476fb229957eed4a4f36b206534","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"samcx","id":28912696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTEyNjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28912696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s

Partial Prerendering (PPR) for an entire application is ideally, the goal for teams wanting to test out the feature or adopt it in their applications to get ready for when it becomes the default rendering pattern. For large applications, with many routes the new behaviours of old API's may prove a difficult pill to swallow all at once.\r\n\r\nThis aims to enable incremental adoption of PPR for pages and routes that want to support it in a similar way to how existing segment-level configurations. Segments can now add:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const experimental_ppr = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo enable PPR for that segment and those descending segments. Any subset of those routes that have it enabled can add:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const experimental_ppr = false\r\n```\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>An aside on the choice of <code>experimental_ppr</code> name</summary>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>It is against common JS semantics to use snake-case, and preference is given to camel-case instead. The choice to make this snake-case was to re-enforce that this is an experimental feature, an ugly incremental path, and ideally, developers should aim to remove all references of it from their codebase.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, this mirrors what we've done for unstable API's like `unstable_cache`.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</details> \r\n\r\nTo disable PPR for that segment and those descending segments. To use this new option, the `experimental.ppr` configuration in `next.config.js` must be set to `\"incremental\"`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// next.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  experimental: {\r\n    ppr: \"incremental\",\r\n  },\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a segment does not export a `experimental_ppr` boolean, it is inferred from it's parent. If no parent has it defined, it's default value is `false` and therefore disabled.\r\n\r\nOnce all your segments have PPR enabled via this config, it would be considered safe for teams to set their `experimental.ppr` value in the `next.config.js` to `true`, enabling it for the entire app and for all future routes.\r\n\r\n### Aside\r\n\r\nI also took the liberty to rename `isPPR` and

What\r\n\r\nStrip the search query for the `urlPathname` passed down to metadata handling. \r\n\r\n### Why\r\nThis is because the `urlPathname` from `staticGenerationStore` contains query, so it will contain `?rsc` query for client navigation, which lead to the relative path canonical url (e.g. `./`) will have the search query along with it. This PR is to remove that and make sure always uses pathname.\r\n\r\nReported by @pacocoursey \n\nCloses

a server action performs a redirect, we currently initiate a `HEAD` request to the targeted URL to verify if it has a proper RSC response. If it does, it then invokes a GET and streams the response. This leads to an extra request to the server which can be costly and poor for performance. If the `GET` returns an invalid RSC response, we'll discard the response. The client router will also see the invalid response which will signal that it needs to perform an MPA navigation to the targeted URL. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What & Why\r\nWhen an RSC triggers `navigate` after the shell has already been sent to the client, a meta tag is inserted to signal to the browser it needs to perform an MPA navigation. This is primarily used for bot user agents, since we wouldn't have been able to provide a proper redirect status code (since it occurred after the initial response was sent).\r\n\r\nHowever, the router would trigger a SPA navigation, while the `<meta>` tag lagged to perform an MPA navigation, resulting in 2 navigations to the same URL.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nWhen the client side code attempts to handle the redirect, we treat it like an MPA navigation. This will suspend in render and trigger a `location.push`/`location.replace` to the targeted URL. As a result, only one of these navigation events will win.\r\n\r\nFixes #59800\r\nFixes #62463\r\nFIxes #57257\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2952\r\nCloses

What\r\nWhen calling `revalidatePath` or `revalidateTag` in a server action for an intercepted route with dynamic segments, the page would do a full browser refresh.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWhen constructing rewrites for interception routes, the route params leading up to the interception route are \"voided\" with a `__NEXT_EMPTY_PARAM__` demarcation. When it comes time to look up the values for these dynamic segments, since the params aren't going to be part of the URL, they get matched via `FlightRouterState` ([ref](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/d67d658ce7396c4b6be1b724be5f45763d5a1803/packages/next/src/server/app-render/app-render.tsx#L153-L201)). \r\n\r\nThe `shouldProvideFlightRouterState` variable only passes it through for RSC requests; however, since the server action will perform the action & return the flight data in a single pass, that means the updated tree from the server action isn't going to receive the `FlightRouterState` when constructing the new tree. This means the old tree will have a `[\"locale\", \"en\", \"d\"]` segment, and the new tree from the server action will have `\"[locale]\"`. When the router detects this kind of segment mismatch, it assumes the user navigated to a new root layout, and triggers an MPA navigation. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis unconditionally provides the `FlightRouterState` to `makeGetDynamicParamFromSegment` so that it can properly extract dynamic params for interception routes. We currently enforce interception routes to be dynamic due to this `FlightRouterState` dependency.\r\n\r\nFixes #59796\r\nCloses

router revalidation behavior for dynamic interception routes (#63768)","commit_message":"### What\r\nWhen calling `revalidatePath` or `revalidateTag` in a server action for\r\nan intercepted route with dynamic segments, the page would do a full\r\nbrowser refresh.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWhen constructing rewrites for interception routes, the route params\r\nleading up to the interception route are \"voided\" with a\r\n`__NEXT_EMPTY_PARAM__` demarcation. When it comes time to look up the\r\nvalues for these dynamic segments, since the params aren't going to be\r\npart of the URL, they get matched via `FlightRouterState`\r\n([ref](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/d67d658ce7396c4b6be1b724be5f45763d5a1803/packages/next/src/server/app-render/app-render.tsx#L153-L201)).\r\n\r\nThe `shouldProvideFlightRouterState` variable only passes it through for\r\nRSC requests; however, since the server action will perform the action &\r\nreturn the flight data in a single pass, that means the updated tree\r\nfrom the server action isn't going to receive the `FlightRouterState`\r\nwhen constructing the new tree. This means the old tree will have a\r\n`[\"locale\", \"en\", \"d\"]` segment, and the new tree from the server action\r\nwill have `\"[locale]\"`. When the router detects this kind of segment\r\nmismatch, it assumes the user navigated to a new root layout, and\r\ntriggers an MPA navigation.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis unconditionally provides the `FlightRouterState` to\r\n`makeGetDynamicParamFromSegment` so that it can properly extract dynamic\r\nparams for interception routes. We currently enforce interception routes\r\nto be dynamic due to this `FlightRouterState` dependency.\r\n\r\nFixes #59796\r\nCloses

What?\r\n\r\nThis adds a script that first gets a list of changed files compared to our base branch (`canary`) in PRs and identifies related test files by looking them up from a `related-tests-manifest.json`, then runs them.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nWe would like to be able to run related E2E tests when certain files change, so we can test deployment stability.\r\n\r\nNOTE: We still want to run all E2E tests on PRs, but this script can be used to also test deployments for hot paths. Since these tests can take up to [3-4 hours](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/actions/workflows/test_e2e_deploy.yml), we aim to run a subset of these tests first.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses

What?\r\n\r\nCurrently `next build` with Turbopack fails to run in certain tests  (as expected), the problem with that is that the `afterAll()` calls assume the server was started, which doesn't happen when the build fails, and then causes a timeout that can't be reported if an error happens. This change ensures the error around `server['__app']` doesn't happen.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!
