configures the default client router cache `staleTime.dynamic` value to be `0`.\r\n\r\nThis means that:\r\n- Navigating between pages will always fire off a network request to get RSC data for the page segment, rather than restoring from router cache\r\n- Loading states will remain cached for 5 minutes (or whatever `config.experimental.staleTimes.static` is set to)\r\n- Shared layout data will continue to remain cached due to [partial rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering)\r\n- Back/forward behavior will still restore from cache to ensure the browser can restore scroll position.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to opt-out of this, and into the previous behavior, by setting the [`staleTimes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/staleTimes) config in `next.config.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\r\nconst nextConfig = {\r\n  experimental: {\r\n    staleTimes: {\r\n      dynamic: 30\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65830, I've been seeing weird flakes from `test/e2e/app-dir/app-invalid-revalidate/app-invalid-revalidate.test.ts`.\r\n```\r\nTIMED OUT: /Invalid revalidate value \"1\" on \"\\/\", must be a non-negative number or \"false\"/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ▲ Next.js 14.3.0-canary.73\r\n\r\n   Creating an optimized production build ...\r\n   \r\n[snip]\r\n\r\nError: Invalid revalidate value \"1\" on \"/_not-found\", must be a non-negative number or \"false\"\r\n\r\n[snip]\r\n\r\n     Generating static pages (2/4) \r\n  > Build error occurred\r\n  Error: Export encountered an error on /_not-found, exiting due to prerenderEarlyExit: true being set\r\n```\r\nNote that there's no `Invalid revalidate value \"1\"` message for `/`, so the test will fail.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a race condition: the invalid `revalidate` value is set in a layout, so if `_not-found` happens to be prerendered before `/`, it'll abort the whole prerender (because of `prerenderEarlyExit: true`). so if the timing is right, the test -- which is looking for build errors for `/` -- will never see them and time out.\r\n\r\nThere might be more of these, but unfortunately they're basically race conditions, so I think we'll have to squash them as they come up.\r\n\r\nCC @ijjk

noted in (https://github.com/vercel/nextpack/pull/103), by not having this as a default feature, when running the `build-native` script it's not able to re-use any cargo caches that might already exist from a default build.\r\n\r\nBecause this feature impacts the swc crate, everything dependent on it can be forced to rebuild.\r\n\r\nBy making this a default feature, the hope/theory is that the number of different ways we potentially build our dependency graph reduces, and cargo cache hits will improve.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Add `plugin` to the default set of features for `next-swc-napi`.\r\n- Consolidate `build-native-no-plugin-woa` with `build-native-no-plugin`. Given the lack of any other default features, these are equivalent.\r\n- `i686-pc-windows-msvc`: Switch to `build-native-no-plugin-release` in CI instead of just supplying the `--release` flag. This has the benefit of also enabling `tracing/release_max_level_info`, which might reduce the size of or speed up these builds.\r\n- `x86_64-apple-darwin`: Remove a redundant `--release` flag in the CI config (no expected changes).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've tested this locally on Linux (`pnpm run build-native`) and Windows-on-ARM (`pnpm run build-native-no-plugin`) by making sure things still build. I'll also make sure CI passes.","created_at":"2024-05-21T00:35:04Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T12:02:46Z","closed_at":"2024-05-22T18:09:04Z","merged_at":"2024-05-22T18:09:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"4ead5fc00db1845f115b960854e1c76c1806b018","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"timeyoutakeit","id":5012825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTI4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5012825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit","html_url":"https://github.com/timeyoutakeit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"leerob","id":9113740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTM3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9113740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leero

Background\r\n\r\nPreviously we introduced automatic caching for `fetch` based on certain heuristics that were a bit tricky to grasp all scenarios. The scenarios we would automatically cache were no dynamic data access before the fetch call e.g. `headers()` or `cookies()`, the fetch call is inside of a dynamic page e.g. `POST` method or `export const revalidate = 0` page and the fetch is a non-`GET` request or has `Authorization` or `Cookie` headers, or the fetch had `cache: 'no-store' | 'no-cache'` or `revalidate: 0`. \r\n\r\n## New Behavior\r\n\r\nBy default fetches will no longer automatically be cached. Instead they need to be opted-in to caching via `export const fetchCache = 'default-cache' | 'force-cache',` `next: { revalidate: false or value > 0 }` or `cache: 'force-cache' | 'default-cache'`. \r\n\r\nWhen the fetch call is automatically skipping the cache it won't impact the page level ISR cacheability although if a fetch call manually specifies `cache: 'no-store'` or `revalidate: 0` it will still bail from the page being statically generated as it was before. \r\n\r\nTo achieve the previous behavior of automatic fetch caching all that needs to be added is `export const fetchCache = 'default-cache'` in the root layout(s) of your project.

@icyJoseph @ztanner\r\n\r\nNOTE: The canary release [`v14.1.1-canary.51`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v14.1.1-canary.51) and below work as expected.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nIntroduced from #61535, the initial prefetch cache is set based on the `location.pathname`.\r\nWhen a page is loaded WITH the search param, the cache key does not contain information of the search param.\r\n\r\nThe issue is when on a dynamic page reading the `searchParams` value, the value doesn't change if navigated as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/?q=foo --> /\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe prefetch cache hits, not re-rendering, and the `searchParams` value is not passed properly.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nFor the prefetch cache, add the `location.search` as well.\r\n\r\nSince `createPrefetchCacheKey` uses [`createHrefFromUrl`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/client/components/router-reducer/create-href-from-url.ts) which includes `location.search`, I'm expecting the change won't affect current cache key behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes #64170\r\nFixes

initial prefetch cache not set properly with different search params (#65977)","commit_message":"cc @icyJoseph @ztanner\r\n\r\nNOTE: The canary release\r\n[`v14.1.1-canary.51`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v14.1.1-canary.51)\r\nand below work as expected.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nIntroduced from #61535, the initial prefetch cache is set based on the\r\n`location.pathname`.\r\nWhen a page is loaded WITH the search param, the cache key does not\r\ncontain information of the search param.\r\n\r\nThe issue is when on a dynamic page reading the `searchParams` value,\r\nthe value doesn't change if navigated as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/?q=foo --> /\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe prefetch cache hits, not re-rendering, and the `searchParams` value\r\nis not passed properly.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nFor the prefetch cache, add the `location.search` as well.\r\n\r\nSince `createPrefetchCacheKey` uses\r\n[`createHrefFromUrl`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/client/components/router-reducer/create-href-from-url.ts)\r\nwhich includes `location.search`, I'm expecting the change won't affect\r\ncurrent cache key behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes #64170\r\nFixes #65030\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Zack Tanner

support for nested `unstable_after()`.\r\n\r\nThis pattern previously threw a \"Not supported yet\" error, but works now:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction MyComponent() {\r\n  after(() => asyncWork());\r\n  return <div>...</div>\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync function asyncWork() {\r\n  after(() => { /* look ma, nesting!*/ })\r\n  // more stuff...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implementation notes\r\nSwitched `AfterContext` to use a proper promise queue ([`p-queue`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p-queue)) instead of plain a callback array to support adding more callbacks as we execute (i.e. from nested `after`s). Used a package because I didn't want to reinvent the wheel here.\r\n\r\nAs a nice bonus, `p-queue` lets us limit the concurrency of running tasks if we're worried about resource consumption. **This PR doesn't do that**, but it's very easy to add.

support nested unstable_after calls (#65950)","commit_message":"Adds support for nested `unstable_after()`.\r\n\r\nThis pattern previously threw a \"Not supported yet\" error, but works\r\nnow:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction MyComponent() {\r\n  after(() => asyncWork());\r\n  return <div>...</div>\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync function asyncWork() {\r\n  after(() => { /* look ma, nesting!*/ })\r\n  // more stuff...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implementation notes\r\nSwitched `AfterContext` to use a proper promise queue\r\n([`p-queue`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p-queue)) instead of plain

Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\nCurrently pages on the Pages Router only accept \"experimental-edge\", not \"edge\". If you use \"edge\", there will be a build error.\r\n\r\nThis is contrary to the documentation, which states\r\n\r\n> You can explicitly set the runtime on a per-page basis by modifying the config, for example:\r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> // pages/index.js\r\n> export const config = {\r\n>   runtime: 'nodejs', // or \"edge\"\r\n> }\r\n>  \r\n> export const getServerSideProps = async () => {}\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> – [source](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props#edge-runtime)\r\n\r\nThis PR allows \"edge\" to be used as the runtime for Pages Router pages.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nEither the documentation is wrong, or the \"edge\" check should be removed. Since in #50701, the `// or \"edge\"` phrase was explicitly added to that part, I suppose the team decided already to fully stabilise the edge runtime everywhere, so I decided to make the PR to remove the \"edge\" check.\r\n\r\nIf the documentation is wrong and the edge runtime should still be marked as experimental, feel free to close this PR *but* please also update the documentation in that case.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nI simply removed the \"edge\" checks. Using \"experimental-edge\" in pages should now result in a warning but things should still work (same as Edge API Routes).\r\n\r\nFixes

The option is presented during the setup process as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWould you like to use Turbopack for next dev? (RC) … No / Yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, the option is set to `No`. When set to `Yes`, the `package.json` script for `dev` is modified from `next dev` to `next dev --turbo`.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Updated the interactive CLI prompt to include the Turbopack option.\r\n2. Modified the `createApp` function to adjust the `dev` script in `package.json` based on the user's selection.\r\n3. Updated the documentation to describe the new option and its use.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nUpdates were made to [create-next-app documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app) to include the new Turbopack option.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nThis change provides developers an opportunity to opt-in to using Turbopack during development, offering potentially faster builds and improves developer experience. Given that Turbopack is currently in RC, the default is set to `No` to ensure stability for most users.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTested the implementation by running `create-next-app` and selecting different combinations of templates to ensure that the dev script updates appropriately.","created_at":"2024-05-18T15:32:45Z","updated_at":"2024-06-02T00:04:55Z","closed_at":"2024-05-18T17:01:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db7ee2cd0ea36dae15c8627f7d8c02034ae145e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"manovotny","id":446260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjI2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/446260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny","html_url":"https://github.com/manovotny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"delbaoliveira","id":32464864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDY0ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32464864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira","html_url":"https://github.com/delbaoliveira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delbaoliveira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[{"name":"Next.js","id":6663311,"node_id":"T_kwDOAOSnPM4AZayP","slug":"next-js","description":"Team

Introduced a new CLI option `--turbo` to enable Turbopack for `next dev`.\r\n- Added an interactive prompt to ask the user if they want to use Turbopack during project setup.\r\n- Updated the `createApp` function to pass the `turbo` option and adjust the `dev` script in `package.json` to use `next dev --turbo` when Turbopack is enabled.\r\n- Ensured compatibility with different project templates (e.g., App Router, non-App Router, Tailwind, non-Tailwind).\r\n- Updated the documentation to reflect the new Turbopack option in both interactive and non-interactive setups.\r\n\r\nResolves

PR addresses an issue where the `dev` script in `package.json` was not correctly updated to use the `--turbo` option when specified. The changes ensure that the `dev` script is set to `next dev --turbo` if the `turbo` option is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n1. **Function Modification**:\r\n   - Updated the `modifyPackageJson` function to include a check for the `turbo` parameter.\r\n   - If `turbo` is true, the `dev` script in `package.json` is set to `next dev --turbo`.\r\n   - If `turbo` is false, the `dev` script remains `next dev`.\r\n\r\n2. **Integration in App Creation**:\r\n   - Integrated the `modifyPackageJson` function into the app creation process to ensure the `dev` script is correctly set based on the `turbo` parameter.\r\n\r\n### Testing:\r\n- Verified that the `dev` script in `package.json` is correctly updated to `next dev --turbo` when the `turbo` option is enabled.\r\n- Ensured that the `dev` script remains `next dev` when the `turbo` option is not enabled.\r\n\r\n### Related Issues:\r\n- Fixes #65924\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\n- This change ensures that developers opting to use Turbopack

The\r\nchanges ensure that the `dev` script is set to `next dev --turbo` if the\r\n`turbo` option is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n1. **Function Modification**:\r\n- Updated the `modifyPackageJson` function to include a check for the\r\n`turbo` parameter.\r\n- If `turbo` is true, the `dev` script in `package.json` is set to `next\r\ndev --turbo`.\r\n   - If `turbo` is false, the `dev` script remains `next dev`.\r\n\r\n2. **Integration in App Creation**:\r\n- Integrated the `modifyPackageJson` function into the app creation\r\nprocess to ensure the `dev` script is correctly set based on the `turbo`\r\nparameter.\r\n\r\n### Testing:\r\n- Verified that the `dev` script in `package.json` is correctly updated\r\nto `next dev --turbo` when the `turbo` option is enabled.\r\n- Ensured that the `dev` script remains `next dev` when the `turbo`\r\noption is not enabled.\r\n\r\n### Related Issues:\r\n- Fixes #65924\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\n- This change ensures that developers opting to use Turbopack for\r\ndevelopment will have the correct script set up automatically.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Arindam Majumder <arindammajumder2020@gmail.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Lee Robinson

follows 2 previous PRs, https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/52251 and https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/61330 by making a 1 year expiry the default for the `stale-while-revalidate` header.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the current default is invalid according to [RFC 5861](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc5861.html#n-the-stale-while-revalidate-cache-control-extension). \r\n\r\nAny user deploying Next.js behind any CDN other Vercel expects SWR to work correctly, but it does not because there is no default expiry value.\r\n\r\nThis change will make the default work for all Next.js users and greatly reduce frustration for those of us deploying Next.js places besides Vercel.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a small edge case where `experimental.swrDelta = 0` would not function as expected.\r\n\r\nThank you!","created_at":"2024-05-16T23:23:23Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T00:04:10Z","closed_at":"2024-05-16T23:32:20Z","merged_at":"2024-05-16T23:32:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"a753a394793d58184c02496bf2162f9e26d8a371","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh","html_url":"https://github.com/wyattjoh","followers_url":"https://api.

Why?\r\n\r\nThe current `lint-staged` hook uses [function signature](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged?tab=readme-ov-file#function-signature) to target the **staged files** and has extra steps for handling those files that seem to have been passed on from a [5-year-old legacy code](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/9245).\r\n\r\nThe entire process is unnecessary today since `lint-staged` only runs on the staged files.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThis PR removed unnecessary logic, removed some no-effect flags, and [removed `git add`](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged?tab=readme-ov-file#v10).\r\n\r\n> If your task previously contained a git add step, please remove this.","created_at":"2024-05-16T17:48:08Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T15:45:36Z","closed_at":"2024-05-30T00:56:31Z","merged_at":"2024-05-30T00:56:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"0558f61c415e8456edd6c22ec3be137c8959d564","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjo

[function\r\nsignature](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged?tab=readme-ov-file#function-signature)\r\nto target the **staged files** and has extra steps for handling those\r\nfiles that seem to have been passed on from a [5-year-old legacy\r\ncode](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/9245).\r\n\r\nThe entire process is unnecessary today since `lint-staged` only runs on\r\nthe staged files.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThis PR removed unnecessary logic, removed some no-effect flags, and\r\n[removed `git\r\nadd`](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged?tab=readme-ov-file#v10).\r\n\r\n> If your task previously contained a git add step, please remove this.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by:

What?\r\n\r\nUpgrades sharp to the latest version and relies on more of its default settings (if the default settings are unsuitable, we should consider improving these for all users in sharp itself).\r\n\r\n- The `sequentialRead` setting is now managed for you based on each input image and the operations to be applied to it.\r\n\r\n- The concurrency detection is more accurate than `os.cpus()` as it now inspects things like CPU set/affinity as well as the memory allocator.\r\n\r\n- The (mostly archaic) concept of chroma subsampling is not required for AVIF output. Using full chroma should improve the quality of red/orange edges, as well as slightly reducing file size as it allows greater use of AV1 chroma-from-luma prediction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR also enables the use of mozjpeg features such as trellis quantisation to produce smaller file sizes. The use of `mozjpeg: true` infers `progressive: true`.

Background\r\n\r\nHistorically during prerendering we have waiting until all paths have been attempted before we exit the process and fail the build. This is nice if you want to collect all potential errors to address them at the same time although this has the drawback of slowing down builds if things are timing out or if the same error is occurring across numerous paths. \r\n\r\n## New Behavior\r\n\r\nThis changes our default behavior to immediately exit when the first error occurs during prerendering so that builds don't stall out from timeout errors or from the same error occurring across numerous paths. This will help from holding up CI or similar un-necessarily. \r\n\r\nIf users want to opt-in to the previous behavior the flag is still present under `experimental.prerenderEarlyExit`.

Background\r\n\r\nCurrently route handlers will be attempted to statically generate the same as normal pages in app router. If a route handler accessed dynamic data such as `cookies()`, `headers()`, `req.url`, or similar we would bail from this static generation but this didn't handle the case where you would do data fetching via a non-fetch based library e.g. `redis` or even using `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` so users would expect these to be run every request like normal API endpoints but they would be static so wouldn't be executed again after a build. \r\n\r\n\r\n## New Behavior\r\n\r\nAs discussed this disable the default static generation handling for route handlers as we've seen this confuse our users since in most cases when creating a route handler you are handling dynamic workloads. This doesn't remove the ability to static generate route handlers though as you can still manually specify:\r\n\r\nIf you specify `export const revalidate = 1` we will still bail if dynamic data is accessed to prevent accidental `revalidate` configuring but this can be avoided via `force-static` being used as well. \r\n \r\n```js\r\nexport const dynamic = 'force-static'\r\n// or\r\nexport const dynamic = 'error'\r\n// or\r\nexport const revalidate = false\r\n// or\r\nexport const revalidate = 1 // value great than 0\r\n// or \r\nexport const generateStaticParams()

What?\r\n\r\nUpdates create-next-app's templates' `.gitignore` files for parity with [Yarn's official recommendations](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored), accounting for Yarn's modern Plug-n-Play functionality.\r\n\r\nFixes #65586 \r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nNew projects initialized with create-next-app presently add various extraneous files from the Yarn cache to the initial commit. This is most notable in the case of the Next SWC binary, which may exceed 100M in some environments (empirically, 64-bit Darwin and WSL2 Ubuntu, and very probably other unix/linux environments), and prevent users from pushing their new projects to free GitHub repositories without rewriting the commit history to exclude the extraneous files, or unnecessarily setting up Git LFS to include them.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nI have errored on the side of exclusion to enable users to push their CNA projects to GitHub as-is and for parity with other package managers, while still providing the opportunity to opt in to additional functionality provided by modern Yarn.\r\n\r\nThese changes follow the recommendations for non-[Zero-Install](https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching#zero-installs) configurations, as Zero-Install functionality is an extension on top of the base package manager experience, and may necessitate additional configuration and present additional complications for unsuspecting users, so I think it's best left up to the user to opt-in. On account of the majority of publicly available Next.js-based projects comprising general consumer-facing websites, it is my belief that the majority of Next projects would not benefit from Yarn's Zero-Install functionality, and that explicitly facilitating it by default would break status quo with all other non-Yarn CNA projects.\r\n\r\nContrary to the example `.gitignore`s provided by Yarn, I've excluded the `.yarn/sdks` directory as it contains IDE-specific tooling;  I feel it would be presumptuous for an environmentally-agnostic tool to target and provide package-manager-specific tooling for specific editors. This too should be left to the user to opt-in to and provide for their project if they deem necessary.\r\n\r\nI have retained the current `.gitignore`'s exclusion of the `/.pnp` directory for backwards compatibility with older versions of Yarn (the files therein have since been reallocated to the `.yarn` directory addressed by these changes, but I am not clear on when that delineation occurred or the prevalence of Yarn installations which depend on the former convention). Maintaining the exclusion here, in the worst case, implies additional downloads (on an order of magnitude merely similar to using npm from the outset) rather than failure.","created_at":"2024-05-15T22:41:39Z","updated_at":"2024-05-27T16:16:48Z","closed_at":"2024-05-27T00:06:25Z","merged_at":"2024-05-27T00:06:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"b3d90983836ee56925d8f3c831628a905ed99787","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2108224491,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTA4MjI0NDkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/create-next-app","name":"create-next-app","color":"9effbb","default":false,"description":"Related

Update CNA templates' .gitignore files for parity with Yarn recommendations (#65823)","commit_message":"### What?\r\n\r\nUpdates create-next-app's templates' `.gitignore` files for parity with\r\n[Yarn's official\r\nrecommendations](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored),\r\naccounting for Yarn's modern Plug-n-Play functionality.\r\n\r\nFixes #65586 \r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nNew projects initialized with create-next-app presently add various\r\nextraneous files from the Yarn cache to the initial commit. This is most\r\nnotable in the case of the Next SWC binary, which may exceed 100M in\r\nsome environments and prevent users from pushing their new projects to\r\nfree GitHub repositories without rewriting the commit history or setting\r\nup Git LFS.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nI've opted to follow the recommendations for\r\nnon-[Zero-Install](https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching#zero-installs)\r\nconfigurations as Zero-Install may necessitate additional configuration\r\nand present additional complications for unsuspecting users, so I think\r\nit's best left up to the user to opt-in.\r\n\r\nContrary to the example `.gitignore`s provided by Yarn, I've excluded\r\nthe `.yarn/sdks` directory as it contains IDE-specific tooling which I\r\nthink is also best left up to the user to opt-in to including.\r\n\r\nI have retained the current `.gitignore`'s exclusion of the `/.pnp`\r\ndirectory for backwards compatibility with older versions of Yarn."},"active_lock_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65822","id":1872166571,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5vlv6r","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65822","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65822.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65822.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65822","number":65822,"state":"closed","locked":true,"title":"test:

optimize.","created_at":"2024-05-15T22:33:50Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T12:03:10Z","closed_at":"2024-05-16T01:00:20Z","merged_at":"2024-05-16T01:00:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"56eb359bea9ace2e7aae8f7bc7f01860c05e5cf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"timeyoutakeit","id":5012825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTI4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5012825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit","html_url":"https://github.com/timeyoutakeit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"leerob","id":9113740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTM3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9113740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url"

Description\r\nFollowing [this pull request](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/63847) recently merged, this pull request adds `experimental_ppr` to the TypeScript plugin's allowed exports.

and [this similar pull request](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/59193) done for `maxDuration`, `experimental_ppr` should be a valid export. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the TypeScript plugin throws an

What\r\n\r\nThis PR exposes new experimental configuration for next.js, `experimental.reactCompiler`. Under the hood, this option configures to use new experimental react compiler (https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler#). `reactCompiler` value can be either boolean or an object contains partial set of compiler itself's configuration option.\r\n\r\nFor the webpack and turbopack both it is enabled by adding a babel plugin for the react compiler.

What\r\n\r\n* Error on case that readable stream controller tries to close but stream is either errored or unfinished\r\n* Delay the DOMContentLoaded event to avoid \"Connection Closed\" error\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nRegarding to the new error about readbale stream controller, the new error we added here is for identifying the connection is closing before the last bit has been received that's an error case not intentional close. It's not a proper state for close more for erroring.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for adding the queuing for the task of dom content loaded callback, after investigation, I found that if the DOMLoaded execute earlier the readable stream controller cuold close earlier on client, which lead to the \"Connection Closed.\" error. Hence we added a `queueMicroTask` here to delay it after hydrate call. \r\n\r\nx-ref: [slack
