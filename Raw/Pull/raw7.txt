What?\r\nThis PR fixes OpenGraph generation code with local assets in Node.js runtime. Also adds some notes on file location.\r\n\r\nThe updated code is validated with my project on vercel.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nI tried loading a file in `public` folder(say `./public/og.png`). The Node.js local assets example code did work locally with `next start` but failed with error message `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory` when deployed to vercel. \r\n\r\nThen I found out the trick here is the relative path. On my local machine the CWD is the root folder so the relative path works, And it seems the CWD is somewhat different on vercel runtime. Then I tried using `process.cwd()` to get the CWD and construct a absolute path, this has been validated with my project on vercel.\r\n\r\nAlso it's worthy to note where the local assets should be placed, so that devs could be less confused.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-22T18:58:06Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T00:07:39Z","closed_at":"2024-04-23T18:07:16Z","merged_at":"2024-04-23T18:07:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"769a19e7b6432ac34ef2404c02aa724fd430fd80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"jh3y","id":842246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/842246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y","html_url":"https://github.com/jh3y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jh3y/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"timeyoutakeit","id":5012825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTI4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5012825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeyoutakeit","html_url":"https://github.com/timeyoutakeit","fo

What\r\n\r\nApply the react aliases for app dir also to the files with `pagesExtension`\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nIn the page bundle of mdx page:\r\n\r\nIn RSC layer react is referencing to the insatlled react 18.2.0 's `jsx-runtime` to create each JSX element. The react 18.2 JSX runtime access `propTypes` of the component type and then it crashes :boom:\r\nIn RSC layer it should use the built-in react canary's `jsx-runtime`.\r\n\r\nThe reason that it didn't use the built-in one is we're using customized `pageExtension` `[\"mdx\"]` for mdx, where we didn't apply all these rules for the files with `pageExtension`, but only the js and ts files by default.\r\n\r\nFor mdx specifically, we cannot only applied to `(page|layout|route).[page extension]` cause every mdx file needs to have proper resolution.

New configuration updates include enabling `dedupe-injected-deps` and changing the lockfile to version 9, with better readability and resistance to Git conflicts.\r\n\r\n- [**v9.0.1**](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.0.1): Resolved issues with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, allowing it to work with lockfiles generated by PNPM v8 if no updates are required.\r\n\r\n- [**v9.0.2**](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.0.2): Addressed a bug where optional dependencies were not linked into dependent's `node_modules`. Fixed some other minor bugs.\r\n\r\n- [**v9.0.3**](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.0.3): Implemented changes to address the `script-shell` option erroring on Windows with `.bat` or `.cmd` files.

Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Set default TS target to ES2017 (continuation of #64508).\r\n- Do not warn about disabled strict mode if strict mode was enabled. This is the case after starting the `dev` command for the first time after having created a new project with `create-next-app`, because in the tsconfig templates `strict` is enabled per default.\r\n- Fix wrongly printed tsconfig changes. See snapshot changes in https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/dc87ebcd561ef522e74fd11c0bf12356472f0268 for details of what was wrong. The bug was introduced in #64508.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nAvoid creating any changes to `tsconfig.json` in a fresh project on first run, and don't confuse the user with wrong logs.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nI fixed the issues in `writeConfigurationDefaults()`, and added unit tests, as well as adjusted the existing integration tests, to prevent regressions. Additionally, I've created a new project inside of the Next.js monorepo with `pnpm create-next-app` and ran the `dev` command inside of this project to verify my fixes.","created_at":"2024-04-20T14:14:28Z","updated_at":"2024-05-11T00:07:17Z","closed_at":"2024-04-26T16:19:50Z","merged_at":"2024-04-26T16:19:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"3438b39fcfd64bec35cbc397d687744a7f3f66df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com

Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI took some time and [wrote a codemod](https://gist.github.com/wyattjoh/0d4464427506cb02062a4729ca906b62) that replaces the old usage of the `createNextDescribe` with the new `nextTestSetup`. You'll likely have to turn on hiding of whitespace in order to review, but this should primarily introduce no changes to the test structure other than using the new mechanism now.\r\n\r\nCloses

What\r\n\r\nReported by @MaxLeiter, when you mixing named import and wildcard import to a client component, and if you clone the module it will missed others exports except the named ones. This lead to an issue that rendered React element type is `undefined`.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nWe're using a tree-shaking strategy that collects the imported identifiers from client components on server components side. But in our code `connection.dependency.ids` can be undefined when you're using `import *`. So for that case we include all the exports.\r\n\r\nIn the flight client entry plugin, if we found there's named imports that collected later, and the module is already being marked as namespace import `*`, we merge the ids into \"*\", so the whole module and all exports are respected.\r\n\r\nNow there're few possible cases for a client component import:\r\n\r\nDuring webpack build, in the outout going connections, there're connection with empty imported ids (`[]`), cannot unable to detect the imported ids (`['*']`) and detected named imported ids (`['a', 'b', ..]`). First two represnt to include the whole module and all exports, but we might collect the named imports could come later than the whole module.

function we use to generate a string with named parameters to pass into `path-to-regexp` currently doesn't properly handle non-word characters (namely, for the purposes of this bugfix, hyphens). As a result, `pathToRegexp` will convert something like `/foo/:bar-baz` into `/^\\/foo(?:\\/([^\\/#\\?]+?))-baz[\\/#\\?]?$/i`, effectively only treating the `:foo` as part of the regex capture group and leaving a dangling -baz.\r\n\r\nThis means using an interception route within a dynamic segment (such as `/foo/[bar-baz]`) would not properly trigger the route interception\r\n\r\nFixes

Internal changes required for the sync\r\n\r\n- caught errors go through `console.error` not `reportError` so we need to spy on `console.error` *and* `error` events to collect errors for the redbox. Ideally we'd move away from `console.error` mocking and `error` event handlers in favor of `onCaughtError` and `onUncaughtError`. But these methods don't compose nicely. I'll have a proposal shortly to make them more useful.\r\n- I had to revert part of https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/56082 since that caused `require('next/dist/compiled/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-server.edge.production.min.js'))` to appear in page.js server bundles which resulted in the installed `react-dom` being used. It may be best to run app-dir tests without React installed to catch these issues earlier. For that to be effective, we'd also have to rewrite fixtures that mix pages and app dir. I'll double check what the impact of reverting https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/56082 is. Maybe https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64992 is an alternate fix for this issue.\r\n\r\n### React upstream changes\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28643\r\n-

Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is related to the issue I encountered at https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/63492. \r\n\r\nThe same problem from the issue exists in the App router and requires this additional configuration (otherwise, users must manually add `isolated-vm` (https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm) to their `experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages`). \r\n\r\nGiven how popular this package is, and based on a suggestion from @feedthejim that I add this entry, I decided to raise this PR.\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`: yes\r\n- Documentation added: yes","created_at":"2024-04-18T20:28:29Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T00:06:59Z","closed_at":"2024-04-24T16:29:10Z","merged_at":"2024-04-24T16:29:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"32bc8065127d72b4856c909ee40fd032364c1fbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/zt

ensures we only track fetch metrics in development mode as that's the only time we report them currently, this also adds an upper limit on how many metrics we store per-request as previously this was unbounded, on top of that this ensures we don't keep tracking fetch metrics after the request has ended as we only report on request end, and finally this adds a clean-up to the reference we attach to the request object containing the fetch metrics once we have used them. \r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/64212\n\nCloses

What?\n\nIn the past folks on the team have reported that anytime the SWC / Turbopack binary changes they had to suddenly run `pnpm build-native` in `packages/next-swc`, even though they didn't build from source before. While investigating optimizing packing for tests I found that it's copying the native binary into the original repository not the temporary repository, which then keeps the file there, even after the tests finish. This fixes the path to use the tmp repository instead.\n\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

a server action triggers a redirect, we're incorrectly applying a refresh marker to the segment they were on, rather than the segment they were being redirected to.

Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\nThis ensures that the body limit option is enforced on all request bodies sent to the Node.js runtime, not just the multipart field size limits.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe documentation states that this should limit the body size, previously it only limited the field size.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThis uses a `Transform` stream from Node.js. [Based on my benchmarks](https://gist.github.com/wyattjoh/c470d98095da2f95f5920396aba2a206) using the transform stream added next to no overhead, yet it did simplify the implementation quite a bit. Assuming this is due to the already performant stream support within Node.js.\r\n \r\n\r\nCloses

recommends blobless clones over shallow clones: https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/\n\n> For these reasons we do not recommend shallow clones except for builds that delete the repository immediately afterwards. Fetching from shallow clones can cause more harm than good!\n\nI've been using blobless clones for development for the last couple weeks. The blobless clone has the benefit of including the full repository history (for the cloned branch). Tools like `git blame` will be slower as git fetches the related blobs on-demand.\n\nBenchmarks (using all the flags in the docs):\n- The blobless clone is faster on my machine, taking 11.1 seconds versus 13.1 seconds for the shallow clone.\n- The blobless clone takes up 256M on disk, versus 244M for the shallow clone. It's worse, but not by much.\n","created_at":"2024-04-18T00:11:07Z","updated_at":"2024-05-03T12:02:29Z","closed_at":"2024-04-18T15:35:49Z","merged_at":"2024-04-18T15:35:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"792b8485fe99e95dec665bad0bc61e6d0126c3bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh","html_url":"https://github.com/wyattjoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.

the router cache can't find a cache node for the requested segment, it performs a request to the server to get the missing data. This request to the server currently will always include the `next-url` header, and on soft-navigations, the router will route the request to the intercepted handler. This lazy fetch is treated as a soft navigation by the server, and will incorrectly return data for the intercepted route. \r\n\r\nSimilar to the handling in `router.refresh`, and the server action

Why\r\n\r\nIf you have a client entry that mixing `default` re-export and `*` re-export, atm we cannot statically analyze all the exports from this the boundary, unless we can apply barrel file optimization for every import which could slow down speed.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// index.js\r\n'use client'\r\nexport * from './client'\r\nexport { default } from './client'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore that happen we high recommend you don't mixing that and try to add the client directive to the leaf level client module. We're not able to determine what the identifiers are imported from the wildcard import path. This would work if we resolved the actual file but currently we can't.\r\n\r\n### What\r\n\r\nWhen we found the mixing client entry module like that, we treat it as a CJS client module and include all the bundle in client like before what we have the client components import optimization.\r\n\r\nIdeally we could warn users don't apply the client directive to these kinda of barrel file, and only apply them to where we needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #64518 \r\nCloses

`AppRouterState` is promise-based (so we can `use` the values and suspend in render), the state itself isn't stable between renders. Each action corresponds with a new Promise object. When a link is hovered, a prefetch action is dispatched, even if the prefetch never happens (for example, if there's already a prefetch entry in the cache, and it doesn't need to prefetch again). In other words, the prefetch action will be dispatched but won't necessarily change the state.\r\n\r\nThis means that these no-op actions that don't actually change the state values will trigger a re-render. Most of the context providers in `AppRouter` are memoized with the exception of `LayoutRouter` context. This PR memoizes those values so that consumers are only notified of meaningful updates.\r\n\r\nFixes #63159\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses
