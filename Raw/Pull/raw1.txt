flag remained experimental because the IPC implementation didn't play nicely with requests containing large payloads, due to it being stringified as GET parameters. This branching logic also poses challenges for some upcoming work related to detecting IO. \r\n\r\nThis removes the handling for the `experimental.staticWorkerRequestDeduping` flag which we can revisit in the future with a sounder approach. This also cleans up some of the IPC server utilities as it wasn't in use anywhere else. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

In cases\nwhere the path ends with something like `.html` it will append the slash\nresulting in `.html/` which causes issues for SEO.  This will validate\nthat if the path has an extension, no slash will be appended.\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

This approach fail the static optimization and make mapping url pretty difficult as parsing the file to check the module exports has to be done before it.\r\n\r\n#### Benifits\r\n\r\nFor image routes urls, this approach could help on static generation such as single `/opengraph-image` route can be treated as static, and then it can get static optimized if possible.\r\n\r\n**Before**: `/opengraph-image/[[...id]]` cannot be optimized\r\n**After**: single route `/opengraph-image` and multi-route `/opengraph-image/[id]` are both possible to be statically optimized\r\n\r\nFor sitemap, since we removed appending `.xml` for dynamic routes, itтАЩs hard for users to have `/sitemap.xml` url with dynamic route convention `sitemap.js` . But users desire smooth migration and flexibility. So it would be nice to have a new convention `sitemap.xml.[ext]` that helps user have route with extension.\r\n\r\n**Before**: In v15 rc we removed the `.xml` appending that `sitemap.js` will generate url `/sitemap` makes users hard to migrate, as users need to re-submit the new sitemap url.\r\n**After**: Now we'll consistently generate the `.xml`. Single route will become `/sitemap.xml`, and multi route will become `/sitemap/[id].xml`. It's still better than v15 as the urls generation is consistent, no difference between dev and prod.\r\n\r\nHere's the url generation comparsion\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nAll the routes are dynamic which cannot be optimized, we only had a hacky optimization for prodution build multi-routes sitemap routes\r\n\r\n|  | only default export | `export generateImageMetadata()` | `export  generateSitemaps()` |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\r\n| opengraph-image.js | /opengraph-image/[[...id]] | /opengraph-image[[...id]]/ | /opengraph-image/[[...id]] |\r\n| sitemap.js | /sitemap/[[...id]] | /sitemap/[[...id]] | dev: `/sitemap/[[...id]]` prod: `/sitemap/[id]`  |\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nMost of the single route will are to get statically optimized now, and the multi-routes sitemap are able to get SSG now\r\n\r\n|  | only default export | `export generateImageMetadata()` | `export generateSitemaps()` |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\r\n| opengraph-image.js | /opengraph-image | /opengraph-image/[id] | - |\r\n| sitemap.js | /sitemap.xml | - | /sitemap/[id].xml |\r\n\r\nNext.js will have less overhead of mapping urls, we can easily multiply the urls generation simply based on file conventions.\r\n\r\nx-ref: feedback from #65507 \r\nCloses

To migrate, simply use the \"Jest: Save Current RunMode\" command from the command palette to update the setting, then remove the deprecated settings.\r\n\r\nx-ref:

PR fixes the same case mention in #66464. Instead of collecting all values eagerly, here we merge fields (on any level of depth) of the same value and skip methods. For example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfoo.bar\r\nfoo.bar.baz\r\n\r\nqux.fn()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously we're (wrongly) collecting `[foo.bar, foo.bar.baz, qux.fn]`, and now it will be just `[foo.bar, qux]`.\r\n\r\nMerging of fields is critical for collecting methods correctly because in theory we can't tell if an object member is a method or not:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndata.push.call(data, 1)\r\n\r\n// or inside a function that does the same:\r\ndoPush(data.push, data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we don't merge fields we'll collect `[data.push, data]` which still fails.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-06T14:20:08Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T16:08:11Z","closed_at":"2024-06-06T16:08:10Z","merged_at":"2024-06-06T16:08:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"04ce445105eed981f0d137888fc977f1b3df1d50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[{"name":"Turbopack","id":6326254,"node_id":"T_kwDOAOSnPM4AYIfu","slug":"turbopack","description":"Turbopack

[--no-warn-ignored CLI flag](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#--no-warn-ignored). It suppresses the warning File ignored because of a matching ignore pattern. Use \"--no-ignore\" to override warning, so manually ignoring files via eslint.isPathIgnored is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nHow about we convert current config as flat config, which would be necessary

What?\r\n\r\nUpdate Docker examples to optimize final image size and improve clarity in dependency management and file permissions\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\nThe Dockerfile examples need to be refined to improve image build performance, enhance readability, and maintain consistency. The updates focus on reducing redundancy, optimizing build commands, and ensuring proper file permissions.\r\n\r\n**Longer explanations**\r\nThe existing Dockerfile can be optimized by:\r\n\r\n- Merging multiple RUN commands to enhance readability and reduce the number of layers.\r\n- Ensuring consistent use of the base image to avoid potential conflicts.\r\n- Setting permissions in a more efficient manner to ensure proper access rights for application directories.\r\n- Improving the clarity of the build process by simplifying and consolidating commands.\r\n\r\n**Based on the Docker documentation**:\r\n\r\nYou can also use environment variables with RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT instructions, but in those cases, the variable substitution is handled by the command shell, not the builder.\r\n\r\nThe updated Dockerfile addresses these points by refining the build stages, ensuring consistent permission settings, and optimizing command usage for better performance and clarity.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\nUpdated Dockerfile samples by:\r\n\r\n- Using a multi-stage build to optimize final image size.\r\n- Merging RUN commands where possible to improve readability and reduce image layers.\r\n- Ensuring consistent base image usage across all stages.\r\n- Setting file permissions more efficiently to avoid potential access issues.\r\n\r\nUsed this setting to confirm that it improves the build process and resolves permission-related problems.\r\n\r\nCloses

such as the native `Headers` / `Cookies` on the `NextRequest` proxy make use of internal slots, so passing `receiver` (the proxy object) which does not have the internal slots on it causes an issue in

failed attempt in #66299 to make server bundles deterministic was grounded in an embarrassing misunderstanding of some Webpack internals. Thankfully, @sokra pointed out my wrong assumptions/conclusions [in detail](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66299#issuecomment-2146797930). This is the most important bit, which pointed me in the right direction:\r\n> The conflict avoidance is deterministic, so you even get deterministic IDs even in case of conflicts. (https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/400db90db807d630b6c9f5e7ccde2b8f01690f3b/lib/ids/IdHelpers.js#L386)\r\n\r\nMore on that in a bit. But first let me comment on this quickly:\r\n\r\n> Different IDs might be caused by different identifiers that are hashed.\r\n\r\nIn my testing, this turned out not to be true. I've observed different module IDs between two builds despite the full list of module identifiers being identical.\r\n\r\nBack to the sorting of the modules: This must be deterministic so that module IDs are assigned deterministically even when there are ID collisions. It turns out that in the case of a failed \"deterministic build\" test, the sorting was indeed different between the two runs.\r\n\r\nHere are the details recorded as diffs between the two runs (shown as rows of `\"<moduleName>: <moduleId>\"`):\r\n\r\n<details><summary><code>modulesSortedByPreOrderIndexOrIdentifier</code> (as used in the plugin, shows the different order)</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/modulesSortedByPreOrderIndexOrIdentifier.json\r\n+++ b/modulesSortedByPreOrderIndexOrIdentifier.json\r\n@@ -47,48 +47,6 @@\r\n

\"pages/api/pages-api/edge\",\r\n   \"pages/pages-page/edge\",\r\n-  \"app/app-route/edge/route\",\r\n-  \"app/app-page/edge/page\"\r\n+  \"app/app-page/edge/page\",\r\n+  \"app/app-route/edge/route\"\r\n ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout being too familiar with the Webpack internals, my understanding is that the order of the entries has an effect on how the `preOrderIndex` for each module is set in the module graph of the compilation. And the `preOrderIndex` controls the result of `compareModulesByPreOrderIndexOrIdentifier` which is used to sort the modules in the `DeterministicModuleIdsPlugin`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my conclusion is to try to make the order of the entries deterministic. Webpack allows either an array of strings for the `entry` config, or an object, but not an array of objects. So I think the only solution to fix this is on our site is to ensure that the insertion order into the entry object is deterministic. We can accomplish that by not modifying the original object in `updatedEntry`, but creating a new one instead.\r\n\r\nWith the fix, I ran the test 10 times in a loop without a failure. Without the fix, the test usually fails after only a few runs.\r\n\r\nI hope I didn't make another wrong assumption along the way, but if I did, please point it out!","created_at":"2024-06-04T21:28:42Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T14:28:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4dc4c2078cd6b07fc9ff71d80f59dab251cc9285","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedtheji

It was erroring in pages api with importing `react-dom/server` as this is disallowed in app but shouldn't be in pages. It's caused by we're validating middleware layer as server components but edge pages api is still bundled in the same layer, where we shouldn't apply the check.\r\n\r\n* Separate the api in api layers, and while handling middleware warnings, checking api layer as well\r\n* No need to check layers while handling externals in edge compiler\r\n* Found a bug that we shouldn't check if `config.transpilePackages` is defined then we enable `externalDir`, removed that condition. It fails the telemetry tests case build with code change from this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd more tests for pages dir and middleware\r\n\r\n|  | `react` condition | `react-dom/server` condition |\r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| middleware (edge) | react-server | not allowed, failed with dev/build checks |\r\n| pages/api edge | default condition | default condition |\r\n| pages/api node | default condition | default condition |\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Use `next-flight-loader` to transform the client components into client reference in middleware and instrumentation.\r\nAdd related required webpack aliases, such as alias for `react-server-dom-webpack`\r\n\r\n3. Keep `api` layer in edge runtime into as `api` layer, which is different from middleware layer. So that we can apply different checking logic. `middleware` will be treated like RSC using `react-server`, but pages runtime still as it is. Worthy to mention that we need to disable the `parser.url` for edge runtime to keep edge runtime chunk in server only code.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nReland this since previous reason to revert this was caused by `externalDir` case, that you need to enable `experimental.externalDir` when import external imports outside of project directory. Since we removed the condition in webpack-config that `externalDir` is automatically enabled when `transpilePackages` is remaining default

proper fix to #66448.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue is that Next.js gets SWC bindings list from `package.json`'s `optionalDependencies` when patching the lockfile. Recently Next.js added `sharp` to the `optionalDependencies`, which causes `sharp` to be wrongly treated as Next.js SWC bindings when matching versions (hence the `undefined`).\r\n\r\nThe PR adds a filter after reading `optionalDependencies`.\r\n\r\ncc @huozhi @eps1lon

revert #66422 , and reland the bundling changes\r\n\r\n### What\r\n\r\n- Apply react-server resolving condition to middleware and instrumentation\r\n- Transform client components in middleware and instrumentation\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nIt was erroring in pages api with importing `react-dom/server` as this is disallowed in app but shouldn't be in pages. It's caused by we're validating middleware layer as server components but edge pages api is still bundled in the same layer, where we shouldn't apply the check.\r\n\r\n* Separate the api in api layers, and while handling middleware warnings, checking api layer as well\r\n* No need to check layers while handling externals in edge compiler\r\n* Found a bug that we shouldn't check if `config.transpilePackages` is defined then we enable `externalDir`, removed that condition. It fails the telemetry tests case build with code change from this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd more tests for pages dir and middleware\r\n\r\n|  | `react` condition | `react-dom/server` condition |\r\n| ---- |

from https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66461#discussion_r1624096023\r\n\r\nWhen using app dir and pages dir together, the [navigation compatibility types](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/48e9cd9b60668c556f4304f8c082d7840db8f53e/packages/next/navigation-types/compat/navigation.d.ts) as introduced in #45919 are added to `next-env.d.ts` with the following triple-slash directive:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/// <reference types=\"next/navigation-types/compat/navigation\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis augments the types from `next/navigation` ([source](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/48e9cd9b60668c556f4304f8c082d7840db8f53e/packages/next/src/client/components/navigation.ts)). But TypeScript fails to do the augmentation and reports the following errors (excerpt):\r\n\r\n```\r\nType error: Overload signatures must all be exported or non-exported.\r\n\r\n> 11 |   export function useSearchParams(): ReadonlyURLSearchParams | null\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this error is suppressed in most Next.js projects, because [`skipLibCheck` is set to `true`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/48e9cd9b60668c556f4304f8c082d7840db8f53e/packages/next/src/lib/typescript/writeConfigurationDefaults.ts#L35) per default. It only arises if users explicitly set it to `false`, e.g. if they don't mind the longer compilation times and want to avoid that third-party dependencies are accidentally untyped because of compile errors. [^1]\r\n\r\nThe error is caused by using a separate export declaration for those functions. If we use export modifiers on the function declarations the augmentation can be fixed.\r\n\r\nI've verified that the e2e test `test/e2e/app-dir/use-params` fails on the first commit of this PR

This means that workspaces did not install correctly. I added `pnpm install` to the `dev` / `build` command but this only works if you run with `NEXT_TEST_SKIP_CLEANUP=1` because the relevant zips are deleted after the install currently. I think we have to move copy before install but need to check with @ijjk first to see if this order was added for a specific reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

'checkout' is a noun or adjective that refers to the act of taking items out of a store after paying for them. 2. Two-words 'check out' is a verb that refers to request someone to look at something. Corrected the spelling of \"checkout\" to \"check out\" in the documentation to improve readability and accuracy.

This approach fail the static optimization and make mapping url pretty difficult as parsing the file to check the module exports has to be done before it.\r\n\r\n#### Benifits\r\n\r\nFor image routes urls, this approach could help on static generation such as single `/opengraph-image` route can be treated as static, and then it can get static optimized if possible.\r\n\r\n**Before**: `/opengraph-image/[[...id]]` cannot be optimized\r\n**After**: single route `/opengraph-image` and multi-route `/opengraph-image/[id]` are both possible to be statically optimized\r\n\r\nFor sitemap, since we removed appending `.xml` for dynamic routes, itтАЩs hard for users to have `/sitemap.xml` url with dynamic route convention `sitemap.js` . But users desire smooth migration and flexibility.\r\n\r\n**Before**: In v15 rc we removed the `.xml` appending that `sitemap.js` will generate url `/sitemap` makes users hard to migrate, as users need to re-submit the new sitemap url.\r\n**After**: Now we'll consistently generate the `.xml`. Single route will become `/sitemap.xml`, and multi route will become `/sitemap/[id].xml`. It's still better than v15 as the urls generation is consistent, no difference between dev and prod.\r\n\r\nHere's the url generation comparsion\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nAll the routes are dynamic which cannot be optimized, we only had a hacky optimization for prodution build multi-routes sitemap routes\r\n\r\n|  | only default export | `export generateImageMetadata()` | `export  generateSitemaps()` |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\r\n| opengraph-image.js | /opengraph-image/[[...id]] | /opengraph-image[[...id]]/ | /opengraph-image/[[...id]] |\r\n| sitemap.js | /sitemap/[[...id]] | /sitemap/[[...id]] | dev: `/sitemap/[[...id]]` prod: `/sitemap/[id]`  |\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nMost of the single route will are to get statically optimized now, and the multi-routes sitemap are able to get SSG now\r\n\r\n|  | only default export | `export generateImageMetadata()` | `export generateSitemaps()` |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\r\n| opengraph-image.js | /opengraph-image | /opengraph-image/[id] | - |\r\n| sitemap.js | /sitemap.xml | - | /sitemap/[id].xml |\r\n\r\nNext.js will have less overhead of mapping urls, we can easily multiply the urls generation simply based on

PR fixes (and simplifies) identifier tracking in the Server Actions SWC transform. \r\n\r\nIn an inlined `\"use server\"` function, the transform tracks which variables are used inside the function body, but defined in an upper-level closure. These variables need to be automatically passed via `$$bound` and encrypted.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we are tracking these variables as \"Names\", which is a pair of identifier and property access list. For example if `foo.bar.baz` is used inside the function body, we track `(Ident(foo), [Ident(bar), Ident(baz)])` as an occurrence and only pass that `.bar.baz` sub-field across the RSC boundary. This saves the bytes being transfered over the network, comparing to passing the full `foo` value.\r\n\r\nHowever, that causes a couple of tricky problems in the past. For example, the transform becomes too complicated so it can handle duplicated fields:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function () {\r\n  \"use server\"\r\n  console.log(foo.bar, foo.bar.baz)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case we need to pass only `foo.bar` as the other one is a subset. And then, there're cases like dynamic field access like `foo[field]` where we need to opt-out.\r\n\r\nThe hard blocking issue that makes me removing this optimization is that we can't tell if a member expression is a field of a value, or a JS builtin method. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function () {\r\n  \"use server\"\r\n  foo.push('123')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case we can't pass `foo.push` over the boundary as it's likely an array. One workaround is to check if it's a function call. But an opposite case can be that `foo` is an object with a field `push` of another Server Action, which is totally valid. And also, the code might not be statically analyzable and we can't tell if it will be a function call or not.\r\n\r\nA better workaround can be keeping a full list of potential JS native method names for data types that are RSC compatible, and opt-out only one of them are seen. But that list is just too long (consider arrays, objects, sets, maps, ...).\r\n\r\nBecause of all the reasons and for simplicity and correctness, I think it's better to just send the full value along.\r\n\r\ncc @sebmarkbage

~1400 assignment calls of `await next.browser()` and `await webdriver()` in the typescript test files currently have an inferred type of `any`. [^1] This impacts DX while writing e2e tests due to intellisense not working for any of the `BrowserInterface` methods, and it also masks other compiler errors in the `test` folder due to typescript apparently bailing out of a full compilation.\r\n\r\nI'm not happy about using so many `any`s here, but this is due to having this abstract `BrowserInterface` class that is not supposed to know about the actual testing framework's types. It's definitely better though than what we have right now. As a next step, either we define proper common types for those, or we merge the `BrowserInterface` and `Playwright` classes and just expose the Playwright types, since Selenium is not used anymore. We could also consider deprecating the custom chain methods altogether, and using Playwright's APIs directly.\r\n\r\n[^1]: Excluding four cases that were explicitly annotated with `BrowserInterface`

#60645, dynamic access tracking was refactored but we erroneously stopped tracking dynamic access in route handlers. Request proxying, as well as tracking segment level configs (such as `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`), were only enabled during static generation. This was an unintended breaking change that consequently caused dynamic access to not properly bail from data cache in various circumstances. \r\n\r\nThis adds some more rigorous testing for route handlers, as this seems to be a fairly large gap in our fetch cache testing currently. \r\n\r\nThis PR is easiest to review with [whitespace
