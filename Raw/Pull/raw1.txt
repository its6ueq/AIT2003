flag remained experimental because the IPC implementation didn't play nicely with requests containing large payloads, due to it being stringified as GET parameters. This branching logic also poses challenges for some upcoming work related to detecting IO. \r\n\r\nThis removes the handling for the `experimental.staticWorkerRequestDeduping` flag which we can revisit in the future with a sounder approach. This also cleans up some of the IPC server utilities as it wasn't in use anywhere else. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

This approach fail the static optimization and make mapping url pretty difficult as parsing the file to check the module exports has to be done before it.\r\n\r\n#### Benifits\r\n\r\nFor image routes urls, this approach could help on static generation such as single `/opengraph-image` route can be treated as static, and then it can get static optimized if possible.\r\n\r\n**Before**: `/opengraph-image/[[...id]]` cannot be optimized\r\n**After**: single route `/opengraph-image` and multi-route `/opengraph-image/[id]` are both possible to be statically optimized\r\n\r\nFor sitemap, since we removed appending `.xml` for dynamic routes, it’s hard for users to have `/sitemap.xml` url with dynamic route convention `sitemap.js` . But users desire smooth migration and flexibility. So it would be nice to have a new convention `sitemap.xml.[ext]` that helps user have route with extension.\r\n\r\n**Before**: In v15 rc we removed the `.xml` appending that `sitemap.js` will generate url `/sitemap` makes users hard to migrate, as users need to re-submit the new sitemap url.\r\n**After**: Now we'll consistently generate the `.xml`. Single route will become `/sitemap.xml`, and multi route will become `/sitemap/[id].xml`. It's still better than v15 as the urls generation is consistent, no difference between dev and prod.\r\n\r\nHere's the url generation comparsion\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nAll the routes are dynamic which cannot be optimized, we only had a hacky optimization for prodution build multi-routes sitemap routes\r\n\r\n|  | only default export | `export generateImageMetadata()` | `export  generateSitemaps()` |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\r\n| opengraph-image.js | /opengraph-image/[[...id]] | /opengraph-image[[...id]]/ | /opengraph-image/[[...id]] |\r\n| sitemap.js | /sitemap/[[...id]] | /sitemap/[[...id]] | dev: `/sitemap/[[...id]]` prod: `/sitemap/[id]`  |\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nMost of the single route will are to get statically optimized now, and the multi-routes sitemap are able to get SSG now\r\n\r\n|  | only default export | `export generateImageMetadata()` | `export generateSitemaps()` |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\r\n| opengraph-image.js | /opengraph-image | /opengraph-image/[id] | - |\r\n| sitemap.js | /sitemap.xml | - | /sitemap/[id].xml |\r\n\r\nNext.js will have less overhead of mapping urls, we can easily multiply the urls generation simply based on file conventions.\r\n\r\nx-ref: feedback from #65507 \r\nCloses

PR fixes the same case mention in #66464. Instead of collecting all values eagerly, here we merge fields (on any level of depth) of the same value and skip methods. For example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfoo.bar\r\nfoo.bar.baz\r\n\r\nqux.fn()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously we're (wrongly) collecting `[foo.bar, foo.bar.baz, qux.fn]`, and now it will be just `[foo.bar, qux]`.\r\n\r\nMerging of fields is critical for collecting methods correctly because in theory we can't tell if an object member is a method or not:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndata.push.call(data, 1)\r\n\r\n// or inside a function that does the same:\r\ndoPush(data.push, data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we don't merge fields we'll collect `[data.push, data]` which still fails.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-06T14:20:08Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T16:08:11Z","closed_at":"2024-06-06T16:08:10Z","merged_at":"2024-06-06T16:08:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"04ce445105eed981f0d137888fc977f1b3df1d50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[{"name":"Turbopack","id":6326254,"node_id":"T_kwDOAOSnPM4AYIfu","slug":"turbopack","description":"Turbopack

[--no-warn-ignored CLI flag](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#--no-warn-ignored). It suppresses the warning File ignored because of a matching ignore pattern. Use \"--no-ignore\" to override warning, so manually ignoring files via eslint.isPathIgnored is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nHow about we convert current config as flat config, which would be necessary

such as the native `Headers` / `Cookies` on the `NextRequest` proxy make use of internal slots, so passing `receiver` (the proxy object) which does not have the internal slots on it causes an issue in

deduping.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-03T18:32:35Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T11:19:38Z","closed_at":"2024-06-04T11:19:37Z","merged_at":"2024-06-04T11:19:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"52689b596042b903e6d4c1a32ec0c6ac6a024e70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/u

revert #66422 , and reland the bundling changes\r\n\r\n### What\r\n\r\n- Apply react-server resolving condition to middleware and instrumentation\r\n- Transform client components in middleware and instrumentation\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nIt was erroring in pages api with importing `react-dom/server` as this is disallowed in app but shouldn't be in pages. It's caused by we're validating middleware layer as server components but edge pages api is still bundled in the same layer, where we shouldn't apply the check.\r\n\r\n* Separate the api in api layers, and while handling middleware warnings, checking api layer as well\r\n* No need to check layers while handling externals in edge compiler\r\n* Found a bug that we shouldn't check if `config.transpilePackages` is defined then we enable `externalDir`, removed that condition. It fails the telemetry tests case build with code change from this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd more tests for pages dir and middleware\r\n\r\n|  | `react` condition | `react-dom/server` condition |\r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| middleware (edge) | react-server | not allowed, failed with dev/build checks |\r\n| pages/api edge | default condition | default condition |\r\n| pages/api node | default condition

from https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66461#discussion_r1624096023\r\n\r\nWhen using app dir and pages dir together, the [navigation compatibility types](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/48e9cd9b60668c556f4304f8c082d7840db8f53e/packages/next/navigation-types/compat/navigation.d.ts) as introduced in #45919 are added to `next-env.d.ts` with the following triple-slash directive:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/// <reference types=\"next/navigation-types/compat/navigation\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis augments the types from `next/navigation` ([source](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/48e9cd9b60668c556f4304f8c082d7840db8f53e/packages/next/src/client/components/navigation.ts)). But TypeScript fails to do the augmentation and reports the following errors (excerpt):\r\n\r\n```\r\nType error: Overload signatures must all be exported or non-exported.\r\n\r\n> 11 |   export function useSearchParams(): ReadonlyURLSearchParams | null\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this error is suppressed in most Next.js projects, because [`skipLibCheck` is set to `true`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/48e9cd9b60668c556f4304f8c082d7840db8f53e/packages/next/src/lib/typescript/writeConfigurationDefaults.ts#L35) per default. It only arises if users explicitly set it to `false`, e.g. if they don't mind the longer compilation times and want to avoid that third-party dependencies are accidentally untyped because of compile errors. [^1]\r\n\r\nThe error is caused by using a separate export declaration for those functions. If we use export modifiers on the function declarations the augmentation can be fixed.\r\n\r\nI've verified that the e2e test `test/e2e/app-dir/use-params` fails on the first commit of this PR

PR fixes (and simplifies) identifier tracking in the Server Actions SWC transform. \r\n\r\nIn an inlined `\"use server\"` function, the transform tracks which variables are used inside the function body, but defined in an upper-level closure. These variables need to be automatically passed via `$$bound` and encrypted.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we are tracking these variables as \"Names\", which is a pair of identifier and property access list. For example if `foo.bar.baz` is used inside the function body, we track `(Ident(foo), [Ident(bar), Ident(baz)])` as an occurrence and only pass that `.bar.baz` sub-field across the RSC boundary. This saves the bytes being transfered over the network, comparing to passing the full `foo` value.\r\n\r\nHowever, that causes a couple of tricky problems in the past. For example, the transform becomes too complicated so it can handle duplicated fields:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function () {\r\n  \"use server\"\r\n  console.log(foo.bar, foo.bar.baz)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case we need to pass only `foo.bar` as the other one is a subset. And then, there're cases like dynamic field access like `foo[field]` where we need to opt-out.\r\n\r\nThe hard blocking issue that makes me removing this optimization is that we can't tell if a member expression is a field of a value, or a JS builtin method. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function () {\r\n  \"use server\"\r\n  foo.push('123')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case we can't pass `foo.push` over the boundary as it's likely an array. One workaround is to check if it's a function call. But an opposite case can be that `foo` is an object with a field `push` of another Server Action, which is totally valid. And also, the code might not be statically analyzable and we can't tell if it will be a function call or not.\r\n\r\nA better workaround can be keeping a full list of potential JS native method names for data types that are RSC compatible, and opt-out only one of them are seen. But that list is just too long (consider arrays, objects, sets, maps, ...).\r\n\r\nBecause of all the reasons and for simplicity and correctness, I think it's better to just send the full value

~1400 assignment calls of `await next.browser()` and `await webdriver()` in the typescript test files currently have an inferred type of `any`. [^1] This impacts DX while writing e2e tests due to intellisense not working for any of the `BrowserInterface` methods, and it also masks other compiler errors in the `test` folder due to typescript apparently bailing out of a full compilation.\r\n\r\nI'm not happy about using so many `any`s here, but this is due to having this abstract `BrowserInterface` class that is not supposed to know about the actual testing framework's types. It's definitely better though than what we have right now. As a next step, either we define proper common types for those, or we merge the `BrowserInterface` and `Playwright` classes and just expose the Playwright types, since Selenium is not used anymore. We could also consider deprecating the custom chain methods altogether, and using Playwright's APIs directly.\r\n\r\n[^1]: Excluding four cases that were explicitly annotated with `BrowserInterface`

#60645, dynamic access tracking was refactored but we erroneously stopped tracking dynamic access in route handlers. Request proxying, as well as tracking segment level configs (such as `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`), were only enabled during static generation. This was an unintended breaking change that consequently caused dynamic access to not properly bail from data cache in various circumstances. \r\n\r\nThis adds some more rigorous testing for route handlers, as this seems to be a fairly large gap in our fetch cache testing currently. \r\n\r\nThis PR is easiest to review with [whitespace

the router encounters a `stale` cache entry, it clears the `rsc` data so that it can be fetched in render. All navigations (even just for hash fragments) flow through the navigation reducer, which has logic to discard any existing cache entries when the cache is stale.\r\n\r\nThis bug has become more obvious after removing the default 30s cache, which would previously have masked it.\r\n\r\nThis updates the existing handling that clears flight data to not do so if only the hash changes as there would be no server changes in this case. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

errors can cause page(s) to fail. When building an app with a lot of static pages, a single page failing to build can be frustrating, especially if it it'll pass on a retry.

a revert of https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66006, but:\n\n- Keeps the cleanup changes from that PR.\n- With https://github.com/vercel/nextpack/pull/106 removing the explicit `--features plugin` flag, we will match behavior between cargo's defaults and the nextpack development scripts (which we want to do for maximizing cache reuse).\n\nThe tradeoff here is faster cold builds, at the cost of waiting longer when you want to test with plugins.\n\nFeedback from @kdy1 was:\n\n> I think it's a good idea to disable plugin by default for nextpack. We don't use it for most of daily development, but it's very large and slow to compile\n\nTested by running both:\n\n```\npnpm build-native\npnpm build-native-no-plugin\n```","created_at":"2024-05-30T17:21:17Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T00:03:18Z","closed_at":"2024-05-31T00:03:15Z","merged_at":"2024-05-31T00:03:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0562529dbfcafab252e08bf49d702d4c652aaa1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kdy1","id":29931815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTMxODE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29931815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1","html_url":"https://github.com/kdy1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdy1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type:
