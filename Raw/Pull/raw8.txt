We refresh because it's possible that the discarded action triggered some sort of mutation/revalidation, and we want the router to still be able to respond to that new data. \r\n\r\nHowever there's a bug in this logic -- it'll only enqueue the refresh action if there were no other actions in the queue, ignoring the case where something is still in the queue. This makes sure that the refresh is handled after `runRemainingActions` finishes. \r\n\r\nWhen adding a test for the server component case (which doesn't hit this refresh branch), I noticed `LayoutRouter` caused React to suspend indefinitely, because it got stuck in the `use(unresolvedThenable)` case. We should only suspend indefinitely if we kicked off a the `SERVER_PATCH` action, as otherwise it's possible nothing will ever break out of that branch. \r\n\r\nFixes #64517\r\nFixes #64535\r\nCloses

What?\r\n\r\nThis fixes the source maps creation for the Next Server.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nAllows for better debugging of the Next Server internals, as well as the React server code, especially in production mode (i.e. `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect --enable-source-maps' next start`).\r\n\r\n**In Chrome:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1608\" alt=\"breakpoint in app-render\"

src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/761683/ea7adc07-273e-4f4b-a1a0-33e7442d9bad\">\r\n\r\n**In vscode:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1608\" alt=\"breakpoint next dev\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/761683/70285a42-1fc7-4e7e-988e-2633f7fbec2e\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1608\" alt=\"breakpoint next build\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/761683/cd087d67-ac22-462f-ad81-39544b41aa85\">\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\n- Copy [React source maps](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26446) into `src/compiled`.\r\n- Load React source maps via `source-map-loader` during webpack build.\r\n- Inline Next.js sources contents into source map files to avoid `loadNetworkResource` error in Chrome DevTools.\r\n- Adjust vscode launch configurations.\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- Hopefully this does not interfere with your current work on React prod builds / source maps, @acdlite?\r\n- Unfortunately, the source maps are not applied in the DevTools Performance panel. [I'm not sure yet](https://x.com/unstubbable/status/1779925144351252581), whether this is something we can fix, or whether it's a DevTools limitation when profiling a Node.js app. It does work when profiling client-side code.\r\n- I've checked that https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/vscode-debugger.md is still valid.","created_at":"2024-04-15T21:12:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-07T00:04:33Z","closed_at":"2024-04-22T12:40:24Z","merged_at":"2024-04-22T12:40:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"f9369327587ff561ecd604b00af0a67e4dcfc17b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com

What\r\n\r\n* Extract `buildId` and server action encryption key into environment variables for edge to make code more deterministic \r\n* Fixed the legacy bad env names from #64108\r\n* Always sort `routes` in prerender manifest for consistent output\r\n* Change `environments` to `env` in middleware manifest, confirmed with @javivelasco this is a fine change without need to bumping the version\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nDynamic variants like `buildId`, SA `encryptionKey` and preview props are different per build, which results to the non determinstic edge bundles. Once we extracted them into env vars then the bundles become deterministic which give us more space for optimization\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses

Info\r\n\r\nI did not create a GitHub issue, but this PR for fixing the issue. Hope that's okay.\r\n\r\n## The bug\r\n\r\nWe run a 'normal' custom server described here: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst next = require('next');\r\nconst dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\r\nconst port = 3000;\r\nconst app = next({ dev, port, quiet: !dev })\r\nconst handle = app.getRequestHandler()\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `quiet` settings is missed in some deeper Next.js internal api calls. For that reason, the setting did not work at all. This works only in production mode.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tried to implement a test in `/test/production/custom-server` but I failed to get the `stderr` messages. When someone give me some guidance, I will add a new test.\r\n\r\nHere are some criteria:\r\n\r\n- need: custom server with `quiet: true` setting\r\n- need: a next.js page with thrown error. e.g. `export const getServerSideProps = () => { throw new Error('failed') }`\r\n- need: collect all `stderr` messages\r\n\r\nI tested the fix in our project by editing the files in `node_modules` -- it worked.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nWe upgrade our project from next `13.3.4` to `14.2.0` and saw this regression. I can not tell in which version this bug was added. We run a Next.js + 'custom server' + Docker setup. Because we have a lot of traffic, we need to suppress the standard Next.js logging and using our own logging.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What?\r\n\r\n- Changes webpack output target to `es6` (required for `async function` output)\r\n- Adds tests for top level await in server components and client components (App Router)\r\n- Converted the async-modules tests to `test/e2e`\r\n- Has one skipped test that @gnoff is going to look into. This shouldn't block merging this PR 👍 \r\n\r\n\r\nAdds additional tests for top level `await`.\r\n\r\nSince [Next.js 13.4.5](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v13.4.5) webpack has top level await support enabled by default.\r\n\r\nSimilarly Turbopack supports top level await by default as well.\r\n\r\nTLDR: You can remove `topLevelAwait: true` from the webpack configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing these tests I found that client components are missing some kind of handling for top level await (async modules) so I've raised that to @gnoff who is going to have a look.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What?\r\nWe strip the `traceparent` header from the cache-key.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nThe traceparent header forms part of the W3C Trace Context standard, installed to track individual HTTP requests from start to end across multiple services. That means each individual HTTP request will have a unique traceparent value, reflecting its unique journey across servers and services.\r\n\r\nIf we include the traceparent header in the cache key, the uniqueness of the traceparent means the cache key would always be different even for requests that should yield the same response. This would cause the cache to always miss and re-process the request.\r\n\r\nEffectively rendering fetch-cache useless.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-15T11:18:54Z","updated_at":"2024-04-30T00:06:20Z","closed_at":"2024-04-15T15:24:28Z","merged_at":"2024-04-15T15:24:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"512cabc1ee14e74c830caaeec916e4f46b0562e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/us

strip traceparent header from cachekey (#64499)","commit_message":"### What?\r\nWe strip the `traceparent` header from the cache-key.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nThe traceparent header forms part of the W3C Trace Context standard,\r\ninstalled to track individual HTTP requests from start to end across\r\nmultiple services. That means each individual HTTP request will have a\r\nunique traceparent value, reflecting its unique journey across servers\r\nand services.\r\n\r\nIf we include the traceparent header in the cache key, the uniqueness of\r\nthe traceparent means the cache key would always be different even for\r\nrequests that should yield the same response. This would cause the cache\r\nto always miss and re-process the request.\r\n\r\nEffectively rendering fetch-cache useless.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Jeffrey

currently emit declaration for files that reference unknown modules e.g. `export { default as GlobalError } from 'VAR_MODULE_GLOBAL_ERROR';` in `next/dist/build/templates/app-page.d.ts`. \r\n\r\nSince the referenced modules are declarated in `compiled.d.ts` which we do publish, I see no reason to not also let `next/dist/build/templates/app-page.d.ts` reference the appropriate ambient declaration file (`compiled.d.ts`). \r\n\r\nThe alternative is marking the whole module as `@internal` but checking if every export truly never flows into a public module takes way more time.\r\n\r\nThis also unblocks the TypeScript 5.4 upgrade in https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64043. TS 5.4 would emit a declaration referencing the appropriate ambient declaration but since `compiled.d.ts` is not part of the program but `misc.d.ts` is, the declaration would reference `misc.d.ts`(`/// <reference path=\"../../../types/misc.d.ts\"`) which is not published and would cause TypeScript compilation to fail.\r\n\r\n\n\nCloses

What\r\n\r\nThis PR's goal is to improve the throughput performance of the Next.js server when handling Pages Router routes.\r\n\r\nNote that the results from this are very synthetic and do not represent the real-life performance of an application. If we only wanted to handle hello worlds, we could probably make this even faster but on production, a slow fetch call to your DB is probably what's slowing you down.\r\n\r\nI'll look into App Router next.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nI guess I got nerd-sniped into it 😃 \r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nA few optimizations:\r\n- I looked deeply at the pipeline for rendering a Pages Router page. I noticed a lot of intermediary streams being created here and there to eventually be concatenated to a simple string. I think this is probably left over code from when we wanted to support streaming there and so there's some code that was shared with the App Router, which we absolutely don't need I think. I refactored it to be slightly simpler with just a few string concats here and there.\r\n- misc: I removed some redundant Promises being created here and there and added a small inline optimisation to eliminate `if (renderOpts.dev)` code in production.\r\n\r\n### Nummies\r\n\r\nTest setup: hello world pages router app, next start + autocannon\r\n\r\n- requests handled in 10s: 18k  -> 33K, **~80% improvement**\r\n- avg latency: 4.89ms -> 2.8ms, **~42% improvement**\r\n- avg req/res: 1846.5 -> 2983.5, **~61% improvement**\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n\r\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/11064311/658e7ade-eba7-4604-a7c9-619bd51a5ec8\">\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\nafter\r\n\r\n<img width=\"880\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/11064311/2f46cf69-b788-4db2-bf90-6f65dc7abd82\">\r\n\r\nAlso ran on the other benchmark by @eknkc.

improve Pages Router server rendering performance (#64461)","commit_message":"### What\r\n\r\nThis PR's goal is to improve the throughput performance of the Next.js\r\nserver when handling Pages Router routes.\r\n\r\nNote that the results from this are very synthetic and do not represent\r\nthe real-life performance of an application. If we only wanted to handle\r\nhello worlds, we could probably make this even faster but on production,\r\na slow fetch call to your DB is probably what's slowing you down.\r\n\r\nI'll look into App Router next.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nI guess I got nerd-sniped into it 😃 \r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nA few optimizations:\r\n- I looked deeply at the pipeline for rendering a Pages Router page. I\r\nnoticed a lot of intermediary streams being created here and there to\r\neventually be concatenated to a simple string. I think this is probably\r\nleft over code from when we wanted to support streaming there and so\r\nthere's some code that was shared with the App Router, which we\r\nabsolutely don't need I think. I refactored it to be slightly simpler\r\nwith just a few string concats here and there.\r\n- misc: I removed some redundant Promises being created here and there\r\nand added a small inline optimisation to eliminate `if (renderOpts.dev)`\r\ncode in production.\r\n\r\n### Nummies\r\n\r\nTest setup: hello world pages router app, next start + autocannon\r\n\r\n- requests handled in 10s: 18k  -> 33K, **~80% improvement**\r\n- avg latency: 4.89ms -> 2.8ms, **~42% improvement**\r\n- avg req/res: 1846.5 -> 2983.5, **~61% improvement**\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n\r\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"image\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/11064311/658e7ade-eba7-4604-a7c9-619bd51a5ec8\">\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\nafter\r\n\r\n<img width=\"880\" alt=\"image\"\r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/11064311/2f46cf69-b788-4db2-bf90-6f65dc7abd82\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\nThis enhances the typings in the `BaseServer`, `NextNodeServer`, and `NextWebServer` to simplify types for request and responses across the entire server. Rather than relying on manual environment checks only as the source with error-prone type casts, this adds basic guards (albeit naive) that assert the typings depending on the runtime environment variables. This greatly enhances the typings used across the servers as the servers no longer use the `as` keyword when working with these request and response types.\r\n\r\nThis is a precursor to future planned work to further split the different rendering runtimes to assist with code elimination and framework organization.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nAs a step to utilizing these more unified types, the `app-render.tsx` (App Pages rendering pipeline) has been modified to instead accept the abstract `BaseNextRequest` and `BaseNextResponse` types. This is a precursor to future work to split the streaming behaviour based on the runtime environment (ie, in Node.js, we can utilize the native streams instead of web streams, which offer significant performance gains).\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThe server types were modified to be generic, allowing the three server implementations to have their types flow safely between the different methods. This enables us to only reference the `NodeNextRequest` within the `NextNodeServer`, and the `WebNextRequest` within the `NextWebServer` for example.\r\n\r\n🎥 [Loom

Rather than relying on manual environment checks only as\r\nthe source with error-prone type casts, this adds basic guards (albeit\r\nnaive) that assert the typings depending on the runtime environment\r\nvariables. This greatly enhances the typings used across the servers as\r\nthe servers no longer use the `as` keyword when working with these\r\nrequest and response types.\r\n\r\nThis is a precursor to future planned work to further split the\r\ndifferent rendering runtimes to assist with code elimination and\r\nframework organization.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nAs a step to utilizing these more unified types, the `app-render.tsx`\r\n(App Pages rendering pipeline) has been modified to instead accept the\r\nabstract `BaseNextRequest` and `BaseNextResponse` types. This is a\r\nprecursor to future work to split the streaming behaviour based on the\r\nruntime environment (ie, in Node.js, we can utilize the native streams\r\ninstead of web streams, which offer significant performance gains).\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThe server types were modified to be generic, allowing the three server\r\nimplementations to have their types flow safely between the different\r\nmethods. This enables us to only reference the `NodeNextRequest` within\r\nthe `NextNodeServer`, and the `WebNextRequest` within the\r\n`NextWebServer` for example.\r\n\r\n🎥 [Loom\r\nVideo](https://www.loom.com/share/76af2225cf0246d0b4f609ab3e35fff9?sid=c948a919-ac9e-4571-8a75-bd9d0a0776e2)\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-3102"},"active_lock_reason":"resolved"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/64451","id":1821558488,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5sksbY","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64451","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64451.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64451.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64451","number":64451,"state":"closed","locked":true,"title":"Fix ASL bundling for dynamic css","user":{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"### Why\r\n\r\nFor app page rendering on edge, the `AsyncLocalStorage` (ALS) should be bundled as same instance across layers. We're accessing the ALS in `next/dynamic` modules during SSR for preloading CSS chunks. There's a bug that we can't get the ALS store during SSR in edge, I digged into it and found the root cause is:\r\n\r\nWe have both import paths:\r\n`module (rsc layer) -> request ALS (shared layer)`\r\n`module (ssr layer) -> request ALS (shared layer)`\r\n\r\nWe expect the ALS to be the same module since we're using the same layer but found that they're treated as different modules due to applying another loader transform on ssr layer. They're resulted in the same `shared` layer, but with different resource queries. This PR excluded that transform so now they're identical across layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What\r\n\r\nFor webpack, we aligned the loaders applying to the async local storage, so that they're resolved as the same module now.\r\n\r\nFor turbopack, we leverage module transition, sort of creating a new `app-shared` layer for these modules, and apply the transition to all async local storage instances therefore the instances of them are only bundled once.\r\nTo make the turbopack chanegs work, we change how the async local storage modules defined, separate the instance into a single file and mark it as \"next-shared\" layer with import:\r\n\r\n```\r\nany module -> async local storage --- use transition, specify \"next-shared\" layer ---> async local storage instance\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses

`renderToReadableStream` if we already know the content will be empty\r\n- Avoid `await stream.allReady` for better parallelism with `streamToString()`\r\n- Increase the `progressiveChunkSize`\r\n\r\n### Improve `createHeadInsertionTransformStream`\r\n\r\n- Only do chunk splitting and enqueuing if the inserted string is not

Why\r\n\r\nCurrently, Server Action handlers are just normal routes and they accepting POST requests. The only way to differentiate a normal request (page access, API route, etc.) from a Server Action request is to check that if it's a POST and has a Server Action ID set via headers or body (e.g. `multipart/form-data`).\r\n\r\nUsually, for existing page and API routes the correct handlers (page renderer, API route handler) will take precedence over Server Action's. But if the route doesn't exist (e.g. 404) it will still go through Server Action's handler and result in an error. And we're eagerly logging out that error because it might be an application failure, like passing a wrong Action ID.\r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\nIn this PR we are making sure that the error is only logged if the Action ID isn't `null`.

#63786, handling was added to the client side router to abort the SPA navigation if a `meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"` tag was inserted into the DOM.\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't consider the case where the `meta` tag is inserted after (or at the same time) as the client side handling of the redirect. This could lead to the client handling the nav, followed by the meta tag being inserted into the DOM, which would then trigger an MPA navigation. To the end-user this would look like the page they were redirected to got reloaded.\r\n\r\nOnce the meta tag is inserted into the DOM, we can't tell the browser to abort the request. This updates the server inserted HTML to inject a script tag that checks if hydration has already occurred before inserting the meta tag. If it has been, this is a no-op, as the client-side router will handle the redirect instead. This also adds the previous meta tag behavior inside of a `noscript` tag as a fallback for cases where JavaScript isn't supported.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nSince this is inherently flaky based on the order that the streaming operations happen in, I couldn't think of a good test beyond the one that was added in #63786. However, when testing locally, I added an artificial delay to flushing the server inserted HTML and it correctly aborted inserting the meta tag if the client already handled it.\r\n\r\nI also added a test to verify that the meta redirect is working properly when JavaScript is disabled -- wasn't sure if that was covered elsewhere already, but seemed like a good one to add. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

modify every field to be read only, ensuring that the type system will help catch accidental modifications to these loaded manifest values as well.\r\n\r\nFuture work could eliminate these types by modifying the manifest types themselves to be read only, only allowing code that generated them to be writable.\r\n\r\nCloses

What\r\n\r\nCSS imports in components that loaded by `next/dynamic` in client components will cause the css are missing initial in \r\nSSR, and loaded later on client side which will lead to FOUC. This PR fixes the issue and get CSS preloaded in the SSR for dynamic components.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nThe CSS from client components that created through `next/dynamic` are not collected in the SSR, unlike RSC rendering we already collect the CSS resources for each entry so we included them in the server rendering so the styles are availble at that time. But for client components, we didn't traverse all the client components and collect the CSS resources.\r\n\r\nIn pages router we kinda collect all the dynamic imports and preload them during SSR, but this approach is not able to be applied to app router due to different architecture. Since we already have all the dynamic imports info and their related chunks in react-loadable-manifest, so we can do the similar \"preloading\" thing in app router. We use the current dynamic module key (`app/page.js -> ../components/foo.js`) which created by SWC transform and match it in the react loadable manifest that accessed from `AsyncLocalStorage`, to get the css files created by webpack then render them as preload styleshee links. In this way we can SSR all the related CSS resources for dynamic client components.\r\n\r\nThe reason we pass down the react loadable manifest through `AsyncLocalStorage` is that it's sort of exclude the manifest from RSC payload as it's not required for hydration, but only required for SSR.\r\n\r\nNote: this issue only occurred in dynamic rendering case for client components.\r\n\r\n### Other Changes Overview\r\n\r\n- Change the react loadable manifest key from pages dir based relative path to a source dir based relative path, to support cases with both directory or only one of them\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-2578\r\nFixes #61212\r\nFixes #61111\r\nFixes #62940\r\n\r\nReplacement for #64021 but only with production

TypeError edge-case for parallel slots rendered multiple times (#64271)","commit_message":"### What\r\nWhen rendering a parallel slot multiple times in a single layout, in\r\nconjunction with using an error boundary, the following TypeError is\r\nthrown:\r\n\r\n> Cannot destructure property 'parallelRouterKey' of 'param' as it is\r\nnull\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nI'm not 100% sure of the reason, but I believe this is because of how\r\nReact attempts to dededupe (more specifically, \"detriplficate\") objects\r\nthat it sees getting passed across the RSC -> client component boundary\r\n(and an error boundary is necessarily a client component). When React\r\nsees the same object twice, it'll create a reference to that object and\r\nthen use that reference in future places where it sees the object. My\r\nassumption is that there's a bug somewhere here, as the `LayoutRouter`\r\ncomponent for the subsequent duplicated parallel slots (after the first\r\none) have no props, hence the TypeError.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nRather than passing the error component as a prop to `LayoutRouter`,\r\nthis puts it as part of the `CacheNodeSeedData` data structure. This is\r\nmore aligned with other properties anyway (such as `loading` and `rsc`\r\nfor each segment), and seems to work around this bug as the\r\n`initialSeedData` prop is only passed from RSC->client once.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Confirmed this is also fixed after syncing the latest React, due\r\nto https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28669\r\n\r\nFixes #58485\r\nCloses NEXT-2095"},"active_lock_reason":"resolved"}]
