For instance:\r\n\r\n`app/opengraph-image.js` can possibly generate two cases: \r\n\r\n- single route: `/opengraph-image`\r\n- multi routes with `generateImageMetadata()`:  `/opengraph-image/[id]`\r\n\r\nWe're not able to detect if there's `generateImageMetadata` defined in the file before mapping the routes, and decided to create the different routes to either `/opengraph-image` or `/opengraph-image/[id]`. That's why we're using a catch-all routes to handle them rn.\r\n\r\nRelated #48106 \r\nRelated #57349

adds a new `layerAssets` property (containing styles and script tags) to `FlightDataPath`. Previously these were lumped in with the `head` node, but we intentionally only ever render a single `head`, to avoid duplicating metadata. This would mean `<AppRouter />` would only ever render imported stylesheets for a single page in a racey way. However, since Float handles hoisting and deduping these style tags, we're safe to render them for each segment. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces no change in behavior, aside from sending `layerAssets` down from the server and storing it in the client router cache.

modifies the patched fetch implementation to better handle when called within an `unstable_cache` callback. In these callbacks, it should not throw an error related to dynamic access.\r\n\r\nThis replaces the verbose `trackDynamicFetch` instead with `markCurrentScopeAsDynamic` which already has support for checking if inside an unstable cache context. It also has been adjusted to be a no-op when `export const dynamic = \"force-static\"`, further simplifying the code within the patch fetch implementation.","created_at":"2024-05-29T19:19:53Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T16:54:05Z","closed_at":"2024-05-30T16:54:04Z","merged_at":"2024-05-30T16:54:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc6d612529ec2954fe13e898abf3d67fa73d8477","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followe

test `deterministic build > should have same md5 file across build` was introduced in #65426 and has since been flaky.\r\n\r\nWhile investigating the flakiness, this turned out to be true: https://x.com/rauchg/status/1766134093174161680\r\n\r\nUpon examining the bundles between successive builds, I noticed that the only difference was that sometimes a few of the module IDs changed.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when defining a custom `DeterministicModuleIdsPlugin` with `failOnConflict` set to `true` in the Webpack config, the builds were failing. The default `maxLength` of 3 (even up to 7) that the plugin is using may yield conflicts in assigned module IDs when building a Next.js app. In this case, Webpack would fall back to assigning unhashed IDs, thus creating non-deterministic bundles. To prevent this, we increase the ID space size to 8 digits. Additionally, we fail on module ID conflicts in test mode to catch any regressions.\r\n\r\nNote: This does have the small disadvantage that the bundle sizes increase slightly.","created_at":"2024-05-28T23:30:04Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T14:49:03Z","closed_at":"2024-06-04T07:48:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48bfccc770256f3030e9ccb5bc51e282e6ceb07d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.git

What\r\n\r\nChange the metadataBase missing warning for all cases to only warn in standalone mode or the non-vercel deployment.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nIn vercel deployments, previous concern was that you might not discover you missed that metadataBase when you deploy. But now we have sth fallback on production deployments. So we only need to warn in non-vercel deployment.\r\n\r\nStandalone is usually for self-hoist, we always warn users to set the `metadataBase` to make sure the domain can be properly

allows us to set breakpoints and debug e2e tests without encountering a timeout after 60 seconds. For example, using:\r\n    \r\n```\r\nNEXT_E2E_TEST_TIMEOUT=1000000 NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect-brk pnpm test-dev test/e2e/app-dir/metadata/metadata.test.ts\r\n```\r\n    \r\nNotably, this change also affects the turbopack dev tests in the CI, where `NEXT_E2E_TEST_TIMEOUT` is currently set to 240 seconds. Since the same env variable is also used for `jest.setTimeout()`, a test timeout will now most likely occur due to jest timing out, and not a specific playwright check (i.e. `waitForElementByCss` or `waitForCondition`) timing out. This sounds acceptable to me.","created_at":"2024-05-28T00:08:44Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T03:21:42Z","closed_at":"2024-05-29T03:21:42Z","merged_at":"2024-05-29T03:21:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"71c21dfc9aca16f71e5b2b5cf1afe34f6d7628af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh"

For example, using:\r\n    \r\n```\r\nNEXT_E2E_TEST_TIMEOUT=1000000 NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect-brk pnpm test-dev test/e2e/app-dir/metadata/metadata.test.ts\r\n```\r\n    \r\nNotably, this change also affects the turbopack dev tests in the CI,\r\nwhere `NEXT_E2E_TEST_TIMEOUT` is currently set to 240 seconds. Since the\r\nsame env variable is also used for `jest.setTimeout()`, a test timeout\r\nwill now most likely occur due to jest timing out, and not a specific\r\nplaywright check (i.e. `waitForElementByCss` or `waitForCondition`)\r\ntiming out. This sounds acceptable to me.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: JJ Kasper

logic from the pages router was previously being hit during development. This was more apparent when PPR was enabled as it was mixing dynamic + static rendering in development which propagated to errors. This change ensures that requests that are made with `RSC: 1` are not marked as `/_next/data` URL's, and don't use the same logic paths.\r\n\r\nPreviously it was a bit confusing because we used the variable `isDataReq` in a few places that made it hard to tell what it was referring to. In this case, the `isDataReq` is actually only used by the pages router. This renames the `isDataReq` to `isNextDataRequest` to make it clearer, as well as refactors to ensure that it's not used in the paths for app routes.\r\n\r\nAlso to better represent the rendering modes the `supportsDynamicHTML` variable was renamed to `supportsDynamicResponse`.\r\n\r\nFixes #66241

is motivated by seeing all the dead code that @wyattjoh found in #66145. For now, it won't help with these specific files just yet because they are still written in JS, but it will prepare us to let the compiler catch those issues whenever we incrementally migrate any legacy test files to TS, and of course also for newly written ones.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, I also spent a couple of hours evaluating whether it would make sense to enable `checkJs` to cover the JS test files as well. But the effort needed to make them compile, which I already did locally for quite a few of them, appears to be higher to me than just converting them to TS, which I also did locally for some. I could create a few follow-up PRs to land those migrations if there's interest.\r\n\r\nNote: I've integrated the contents of `tsconfig.base.json` into the root `tsconfig.json` since this was now the only one extending from it.

reverts commit https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/637033c41054ee1d50107b1fd63a91a2051e1653.\r\n\r\nWhat wasn't clear originally is that we require that required packages have their `package.json` resolvable. So either they don't have an `exports` field, or their `package.json` is listed in the `exports` field. The React beta types didn't have `package.json` entry in `exports` so we accidentally thought they weren't installed. \r\n\r\nI published [`19.0.0-beta.2` that has `package.json` in `exports`](https://github.com/eps1lon/DefinitelyTyped/pull/31/commits/13879ee571bd3996ad2dffd58a288e9762bf31d1#diff-81cc573aa0c2bd0e13f9463499747741704aabccd7474f544db710befd7bcfc4R44) so we can restore the old behavior. It's still questionable IMO to do all that I/O work just for a nicer error message that may contain false-positive but that's for another time.","created_at":"2024-05-23T13:47:55Z","updated_at":"2024-06-07T00:04:32Z","closed_at":"2024-05-23T14:01:10Z","merged_at":"2024-05-23T14:01:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"41a80533f900467e1b788bd2673abe2dca20be6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjo

runtime.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we wouldn't check the context at all unless `minimalMode` was set, and defaulted `waitUntil` to a noop otherwise. This would make integration more difficult for providers who don't use `minimalMode`, because they'd have no way to inject their `waitUntil`

This is a bug in Next.js.] {\r\n  name: 'InvariantError'\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand since `unstable_after` relies on `onClose`, no callbacks are called.\r\n\r\nI believe this is because `web-server` [calls `res.send()` pretty early for streaming responses](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/b9817f83519fdaa7a7fcd4711dfb80aa1e1a2434/packages/next/src/server/web-server.ts#L311), so `res.sent` becomes `true` even though we're still streaming, and prevents us from calling `onClose` in the streaming render. It makes more sense to check the CloseController's `isClosed` instead -- when that becomes `true`, we _really_ shouldn't call onClose anymore (points to a bug), but before that it's fine.","created_at":"2024-05-22T22:50:30Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T12:02:26Z","closed_at":"2024-05-22T23:17:24Z","merged_at":"2024-05-22T23:17:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"a8e011417428b24daf6153e95c87791d487f2c74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjo

like to warn users if they have particularly slow file IO, so that they can correct the problem themselves, and don't send us reports of poor performance.\r\n\r\n- Feature request: https://vercel.slack.com/archives/C03KAR5DCKC/p1716051650641529\r\n- Tweet about how Bun does this: https://x.com/jarredsumner/status/1637549427677364224\r\n- Bun implementation: https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/06a9aa80c38b08b3148bfeabe560697956d38a64/src/install/install.zig#L3038\r\n\r\n**Why 100ms?** Bun used to use 10ms, found it too noisy, and switched to 100ms.\r\n\r\nThis benchmark should run non-blocking in the background and should not meaningfully slow down server startup (even on slow disks).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI looked around and found https://github.com/schoentoon/slowpokefs/. It hasn't been updated in 10 years, but still seems to build fine.\r\n\r\nIn a nextjs project directory, turn `.next` into an artifically slow mount point:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfusermount -uz .next; rm -rf .next .next.real && mkdir .next .next.real && ~/slowpokefs/slowpokefs -m 50 -M 50 --no-slow-read -F .next.real .next\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"695\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-21 at 4 14 58‚ÄØPM\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/180404/217d7692-33cf-42b7-bbf7-5a530b9e0df1\">\r\n\r\nRun `pnpm dev --turbo` and see that the warning is generated.\r\n\r\nI'll also grab a really old USB 2.0 external HDD from home tomorrow and verify that I can trigger the warning with that.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n- Is `println!` good enough here? That seems like the only option we have right now for showing things to the user from within Rust. It would be nicer if we could use something structured like `tracing`, but that's not shown to the user.\r\n- Is there some better place to put this check?\r\n- Is the `.next` directory the right place to do this?

the revert in #66049 \r\n\r\nIt was erroring in pages api with importing `react-dom/server` as this is disallowed in app but shouldn't be in pages. It's caused by we're validating middleware layer as server components but edge pages api is still bundled in the same layer, where we shouldn't apply the check.\r\n\r\n* Separate the api in api layers, and while handling middleware warnings, checking api layer as well\r\n* No need to check layers while handling externals in edge compiler\r\n* Found a bug that we shouldn't check if `config.transpilePackages` is defined then we enable `externalDir`, removed that condition. It fails the telemetry tests case build with code change from this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd more tests for pages dir and middleware\r\n\r\n|  | `react` condition | `react-dom/server` condition |\r\n| ---- |

[Improve debugging for GH changelog](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/9f1d7014afdba2caa9e671fbbfcd518d9093d621) \r\n\r\n   Adds support for `GITHUB_TOKEN=*** pnpm run sync-react`.\r\n   The token is optional.\r\n   Specifying one, helps prevent rate limiting during development.","created_at":"2024-05-21T19:04:34Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T00:09:11Z","closed_at":"2024-05-21T21:10:09Z","merged_at":"2024-05-21T21:10:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"99f59438c3417dfe02b79708d8b450afe0aff704","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by:
