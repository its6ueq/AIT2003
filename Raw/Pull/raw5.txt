What?\r\n\r\nAdding packages from the Effect ecosystem to the list of optimized-by-default imports\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nEffect usage includes very liberal use of `import * as Module from \"effect/Module\"` and `import { Module } from \"effect\"`. This is usually trees-shaken but in nextjs we must declare it to be optimized to be have this way. To provide a better experience to users I added all the packages in the ecosystem to the list that are possibly relevant. I don't expect all of them to get in, but the proposal should start from the full set of possible candidates. Not included are `/cli`, `/printer`, `/printer-ansi`, and `/vitest`.\r\n\r\nAt the very least `effect` and `/schema` should be added for their prevalence, but even if there is hesitance I recommend adding `/platform` and `/platform-node` since it's natural for effect usage to grow into benefitting from these quickly enough.\r\n\r\nRelated issue in the effect repo

This is usually\r\ntrees-shaken but in nextjs we must declare it to be optimized to be have\r\nthis way. To provide a better experience to users I added all the\r\npackages in the ecosystem to the list that are possibly relevant.

Not included are `/cli`,\r\n`/printer`, `/printer-ansi`, and `/vitest`.\r\n\r\nAt the very least `effect` and `/schema` should be added for their\r\nprevalence, but even if there is hesitance I recommend adding\r\n`/platform` and `/platform-node` since it's natural for effect usage to\r\ngrow into benefitting from these quickly enough.\r\n\r\nRelated issue in the effect repo \r\nhttps://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/issues/2701\r\n\r\ncited source for taken action:\r\n[the vercel\r\nblog](https://vercel.com/blog/how-we-optimized-package-imports-in-next-js)\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nAdding strings to a set\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: JJ Kasper <jj@jjsweb.site>"},"active_lock_reason":"resolved"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65463","id":1858623675,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5uyFi7","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65463","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65463.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65463.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65463","number":65463,"state":"closed","locked":true,"title":"add experimental flag to allow forcing NODE_ENV=development in builds","user":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"For debugging purposes, it can be useful to set `NODE_ENV=development` during a `next build`.

Since it's on edge runtime and only run on server but not on client, it doesn't need to include the client react bundles. Hence we apply `react-server` export condition, that if users import React we can only bundle server required APIs and if users use React client hooks we can error.","created_at":"2024-05-06T20:18:58Z","updated_at":"2024-05-28T21:30:31Z","closed_at":"2024-05-12T12:26:37Z","merged_at":"2024-05-12T12:26:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"6635cc07a4e074895b00832eb957f589c26eba93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh","html_url":"https:

What?\r\n\r\nImplements support for running the Turbopack trace server, which is the websocket server that powers https://turbo-trace-viewer.vercel.app/ when using `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACE_SERVER=1`.\r\n\r\nCurrently you have to manually run the server through the Turbo repository which in practice means that only people working on Turbopack are able to run it.\r\n\r\nWith the bindings implemented anyone should be able to run the trace server.\r\n\r\nNote that the traces that come out of Turbopack are very low level, they're meant for optimizing Turbopack like finding slowdowns / large memory usage / optimizing performance. \r\n\r\nHowever, it's useful for people that want to peek into why their application is slow to compile. I.e. we've used https://turbo-trace-viewer.vercel.app to investigate reports in #48748.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for `trace.log` by default, so if you add `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACE_SERVER=1` it will automatically select the `trace.log` for the current instance of Next.js. You can only have one trace server running at the same time.\r\n\r\n### `next internal` \r\n\r\nIn order to support running the trace server standalone, which is useful for investigating trace files other people have shared, I've added a new subcommand `internal` that is not covered by semver / use at your own risk. It's meant for internal tools that are useful to be bound to the version of Next.js, the turbo-trace-server is a great example of that as it has an internal binary format for storing data that needs to match the trace.log file.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take a look at `.next/trace` instead the new `next internal` subcommand can be used for that:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Replace [path] with a path to a file.\r\nnext internal turbo-trace-server [path]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnext internal turbo-trace-server ~/Downloads/trace\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently the trace server does not support loading multiple files, just hasn't been implemented yet. Once we can load two or more files we can load both `.next/trace` and `trace.log` when `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACE_SERVER=1` and support multiple paths passed to `next internal turbo-trace-server`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Turbopack upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\nPR includes a Turbopack upgrade:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8073 <!-- OJ Kwon - feat(webpack-loaders): support dummy span interface  -->\r\n* https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8083 <!-- OJ Kwon - fix(webpack): print resource, project path when relative calc fails  -->\r\n* https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8094 <!-- Tim Neutkens - Implement bindings for Turbopack trace server  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Turbopack trace server bindings (#65410)","commit_message":"## What?\r\n\r\nImplements support for running the Turbopack trace server, which is the\r\nwebsocket server that powers https://turbo-trace-viewer.vercel.app/ when\r\nusing `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACE_SERVER=1`.\r\n\r\nCurrently you have to manually run the server through the Turbo\r\nrepository which in practice means that only people working on Turbopack\r\nare able to run it.\r\n\r\nWith the bindings implemented anyone should be able to run the trace\r\nserver.\r\n\r\nNote that the traces that come out of Turbopack are very low level,\r\nthey're meant for optimizing Turbopack like finding slowdowns / large\r\nmemory usage / optimizing performance.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's useful for people that want to peek into why their\r\napplication is slow to compile. I.e. we've used\r\nhttps://turbo-trace-viewer.vercel.app to investigate reports in #48748.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for `trace.log` by default, so if you add\r\n`NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACE_SERVER=1` it will\r\nautomatically select the `trace.log` for the current instance of\r\nNext.js. You can only have one trace server running at the same time.\r\n\r\n### `next internal` \r\n\r\nIn order to support running the trace server standalone, which is useful\r\nfor investigating trace files other people have shared, I've added a new\r\nsubcommand `internal` that is not covered by semver / use at your own\r\nrisk. It's meant for internal tools that are useful to be bound to the\r\nversion of Next.js, the turbo-trace-server is a great example of that as\r\nit has an internal binary format for storing data that needs to match\r\nthe trace.log file.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take a look at `.next/trace` instead the new `next\r\ninternal` subcommand can be used for that:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Replace [path] with a path to a file.\r\nnext internal turbo-trace-server [path]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnext internal turbo-trace-server ~/Downloads/trace\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently the trace server does not support loading multiple files, just\r\nhasn't been implemented yet. Once we can load two or more files we can\r\nload both `.next/trace` and `trace.log` when\r\n`NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACE_SERVER=1` and support multiple paths passed to\r\n`next internal turbo-trace-server`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Turbopack upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\nPR includes a Turbopack upgrade:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8073 <!-- OJ Kwon -\r\nfeat(webpack-loaders): support dummy span interface -->\r\n* https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8083 <!-- OJ Kwon - fix(webpack):\r\nprint resource, project path when relative calc fails -->\r\n* https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8094 <!-- Tim Neutkens -\r\nImplement bindings for Turbopack trace server -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

revalidating a page that corresponds with a dynamic path and when using the “type” parameter, eg `revalidatePath(“/dynamic/1”, “page”)` corresponding with `/dynamic/[id]`, the wrong cache tags would be checked to determine if a revalidation occurred.\r\n\r\nThis is because the “derived” cache tags created for a `/dynamic/[id]/page` are: \r\n- /dynamic/[id]/layout\r\n- /dynamic/[id]/page\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a tag is added for the current canonical URL, so the final tag would be:\r\n- /dynamic/1\r\n\r\nThus a fetch on `/dynamic/1` would be tagged with the following:\r\n- /layout\r\n- /dynamic/layout\r\n- /dynamic/[id]/layout\r\n- /dynamic/[id]/page\r\n- /dynamic/1\r\n\r\nCalling `revalidatePath(“/dynamic/1”, “page”)` would signal to revalidate caches tagged `/dynamic/1/page` in the current logic.

`revalidatePath(“/dynamic/1”, “page”)`\r\ncorresponding with `/dynamic/[id]`, the wrong cache tags would be\r\nchecked to determine if a revalidation occurred.\r\n\r\nThis is because the “derived” cache tags created for a\r\n`/dynamic/[id]/page` are: \r\n- /dynamic/[id]/layout\r\n- /dynamic/[id]/page\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a tag is added for the current canonical URL, so the final\r\ntag would be:\r\n- /dynamic/1\r\n\r\nThus a fetch on `/dynamic/1` would be tagged with the following:\r\n- /layout\r\n- /dynamic/layout\r\n- /dynamic/[id]/layout\r\n- /dynamic/[id]/page\r\n- /dynamic/1\r\n\r\nCalling `revalidatePath(“/dynamic/1”, “page”)` would signal to\r\nrevalidate caches tagged `/dynamic/1/page` in the current logic.\r\nHowever, this tag doesn’t exist given the above, so it would be a no-op\r\nand wouldn't properly re-invoke the fetch.\r\n\r\nThis updates the docs to explicitly call out that if you are attempting\r\nto revalidate a path that corresponds with a dynamic page, that you\r\nshould not provide a \"type\" argument.\r\n\r\nFixes #62071\r\nCloses

`notFound()` is thrown from metadata, it's caught by a `<MetadataOutlet />` rendered as a sibling to the page component. But we currently only pass the custom not-found component to the `<NotFoundBoundary />` for the `children` slot. This means that if a parallel route throws a `notFound()` in `generateMetadata`, it'd be caught by the root not found, which would be unexpected.\r\n\r\nThis mirrors the logic for determining whether or not a `notFound` boundary should be provided. A side effect of this is that if you throw a `notFound()` in `generateMetadata` for a segment that _only_ has parallel routes, and no `children` slot, it won't be caught by the boundary. But fixing this will require a larger refactor. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

correct not-found component when triggered from a parallel route (#65343)","commit_message":"When `notFound()` is thrown from metadata, it's caught by a\r\n`<MetadataOutlet />` rendered as a sibling to the page component. But we\r\ncurrently only pass the custom not-found component to the\r\n`<NotFoundBoundary />` for the `children` slot. This means that if a\r\nparallel route throws a `notFound()` in `generateMetadata`, it'd be\r\ncaught by the root not found, which would be unexpected.\r\n\r\nThis mirrors the logic for determining whether or not a `notFound`\r\nboundary should be provided. A side effect of this is that if you throw\r\na `notFound()` in `generateMetadata` for a segment that _only_ has\r\nparallel routes, and no `children` slot, it won't be caught by the\r\nboundary. But fixing this will require a larger refactor.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Not easy to remove unless we have separate implementation of `next/image` for pages and app router\r\n\r\nCloses

removed the pages router implementation from the `with-apollo` example and replaced it with an app router implementation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it did so in an unsupported way.  \r\nAt this point, we can not support any streaming SSR scenario without additional helper packages - in the case of the app router, it is vital to use the `@apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support` package.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches the example to our officially supported patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n#63537 introduced an issue where compilation of a new route (like an api route) on the pages router during local webpack dev caused the hash of _document.js to change, forcing active hmr pages to do a full page refresh.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply forces the above-mentioned PR to only apply during production builds and not during dev (likely the time you care about optimizing imports anyway)\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned bug was causing issues for our local dev as the page would refresh as soon as we hit an api route","created_at":"2024-05-01T19:27:56Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T00:04:47Z","closed_at":"2024-05-02T15:11:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"af8969835e17199528f4ec0214eea59672e04247","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[{"name":"Turbopack","id":6326254,"node_id":"T_kwDOAOSnPM4AYIfu","slug":"turbopack","description":"Turbopack

a previous PR, https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/47302, detection for `fetchPriority` assumed that https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/25927 would land in react@18.3.0 because that was the react@canary version at the time. However, it didn't land in react@18.3.0 and it is expected to land in react@19.0.0 due to the breaking change.\r\n\r\nThis means that users upgrading to react@18.3.0 will see a warning.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to stop looking at the `React.version` string and instead check for `React.use`, a feature that [will land in react@19.0.0](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19#new-feature-use) but is also available in react@canary and react@beta today.\r\n\r\nNote: There were tests added for App Router and Pages Router in a previous PR https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/47302 but they seem to run on react@18.2.0 which is why we don't see failures.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/65161\r\n\r\nRelated

Why?\n\n`polyfill-nomodule.js` is a pre-built file containing polyfills for older browsers (gated by the `<script>` tag `nomodule` attribute).\n\n### How?\n\n- The turbopack server needs to emit a raw OutputAsset for this file, so that it is copied into the output chunks directory.\n- That file needs to be passed into `polyfillFiles`, and preserved when we're merging manifests inside of the development server.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n```\nHEADLESS=true pnpm testonly-dev test/e2e/app-dir/app/index.test.ts -t 'should serve polyfills for browsers that do not support modules'\nHEADLESS=true pnpm testonly-dev-turbo test/e2e/app-dir/app/index.test.ts -t 'should serve polyfills for browsers that do not support modules'\n```\n\nBuild a project with `next dev --turbo` and inspect:\n\n![Screenshot

Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added.

What?\r\n\r\nInitially added `@node-rs/argon2` to the list as `argon2` was already in the list to make the provided reproduction pass, however, when digging deeper into Lucia I found that `oslo` also uses `@node-rs/bcrypt`. \r\n\r\nI also looked at Lucia example [1](https://github.com/lucia-auth/examples/blob/main/nextjs-app/username-and-password/next.config.js#L2-L6) and [2](https://github.com/lucia-auth/examples/blob/main/nextjs-app/username-and-password/next.config.js#L2-L6) which show that this configuration is always added: `serverComponentsExternalPackages: [\"oslo\"]`.\r\n\r\nThat shouldn't be needed as we keep a list of packages that can't be bundled in Next.js itself, so I've updated the list to add `oslo`, `@node-rs/argon2`, and `@node-rs/bcrypt`. \r\n\r\nThis makes it so that you don't have to add additional configuration to use Lucia.\r\n\r\nFixes #63850\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What?\r\n\r\nAlways use latest canary in reproduction templates\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nFollowing up with the new PR #64967, it appears that CodeSandbox caches `package.json` and the changes made to it from `pnpm update next` - which uses an outdated canary version of Next.js\r\n\r\nEg. currently, the reproduction template URL uses `next@14.3.0-canary.26` is not the latest canary\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-30 at 12 44 24](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/1935696/fdbebbae-b4b9-4e51-a1f5-46d1a59c7b76)\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nSwitch CodeSandbox \"dev\" task to update the pinned canary version of Next.js in the cached `package.json` to the latest Next.js canary:\r\n\r\n- old: `pnpm update next`\r\n- new: `pnpm update next@canary`\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pnpm update next@canary\r\nPackages: +4 -4\r\n++++----\r\nProgress: resolved 65, reused 43, downloaded 0, added 0, done\r\n\r\ndependencies:\r\n- next 14.3.0-canary.26\r\n+ next 14.3.0-canary.32\r\n\r\nDone in 2.9s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will:\r\n\r\nA) upgrade the pinned version in the cached `package.json` file\r\nB) perform this upgrade on forking of the sandbox (because of `restartOn.clone = true`)\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n\r\nUsers restarting the `dev` task for any reason will get the (potentially unwanted) side effect of upgrading Next.js to the latest canary:\r\n\r\n1.⁠ User creates a reproduction on a certain canary version\r\n2.⁠ ⁠⁠New canary version is released\r\n3.⁠ ⁠⁠User restarts the `dev` task for any reason\r\n4.⁠ ⁠⁠Next.js version updated, potentially leading to the bug disappearing from the reproduction (URL may be published somewhere publicly) 💥\r\n\r\nThis could be seen as unexpected behavior / a \"paper cut\".\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems like the tradeoff is worth it, as having the latest canary on all new reproductions is higher value than allowing the potential (less common) action of restarting the `dev` task in a devbox.\r\n\r\nIn future, I would however like to explore solutions with CodeSandbox that will allow for restarting the dev server without this unwanted side effect, eg. potentially [with an environment variable or something similar](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64967#issuecomment-2083480368).\r\n\r\ncc
