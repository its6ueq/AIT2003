enhancing the typings across the codebase, this resolves some errors discovered while running tests. During development, previously, if the websocket request was forwarded down to the route resolver, it would fail. This is because a `Duplex` stream is not a `ServerResponse`.\r\n\r\nI opted to use the `MockedResponse` here to ensure the remaining code didn't change, as we're only using the resolve routes code to identify a match rather than actually sending the response on. The response data is sent later with the `proxyRequest` which here does have support for `Duplex` streams.","created_at":"2024-05-14T19:18:27Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T12:01:59Z","closed_at":"2024-05-15T01:55:38Z","merged_at":"2024-05-15T01:55:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c3577d73c1dedd1302cfaa8defd04f6a0e3e937","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type:

Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces a **breaking change** that returns a 400 error if the Image Optimization API is given a protocol-relative URL.\r\n\r\nThe Image Optimization API currently checks whether the given image URL is relative by checking `url.startsWith('/')`. This means that protocol-relative URLs, such as `//example.com`, pass the check and are treated as relative. They in turn skip any kind of validation provided when matching against `remotePatterns` and are passed back to the optimation logic as a relative URL.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the stack stops there, but in our case at GitBook it led to a nasty attack where non-GitBook content could be served over this URL: https://docs.gitbook.com/_next/image?url=//example.com&w=1200&q=100 - even though we have configured `remotePatterns` to protect against it.\r\n\r\nI originally went into the problem wanting to handle the URL properly (treating it as an absolute URL and potentially using the protocol of the Optimization API itself as the relative protocol), but after seeing the code in \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/client/legacy/image.tsx#L135\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/shared/lib/image-loader.ts#L26\r\n\r\nit feels that protocol-relative URLs are just not really supported anywhere. My understanding is that very few uses of `next/image` will be allowed to use protocol-relative URLs, so the impact of this breaking change should be quite low? If others disagree I am happy to modify and to use the protocol of the request as a stand-in for the relative protocol.","created_at":"2024-05-14T17:33:04Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T00:04:30Z","closed_at":"2024-05-15T22:21:08Z","merged_at":"2024-05-15T22:21:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9ce336a13b84e52980dee31ef8c68316242d403","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"shuding","id":3676859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3676859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding","html_url":"https://github.com/shuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"manovotny","id":446260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjI2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/446260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotny","html_url":"https://github.com/manovotny","followers_url":"http

protocol-relative URL.\r\n\r\nThe Image Optimization API currently checks whether the given image URL\r\nis relative by checking `url.startsWith('/')`. This means that\r\nprotocol-relative URLs, such as `//example.com`, pass the check and are\r\ntreated as relative. They in turn skip any kind of validation provided\r\nwhen matching against `remotePatterns` and are passed back to the\r\noptimation logic as a relative URL.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the stack stops there, but in our case at GitBook it led\r\nto a nasty attack where non-GitBook content could be served over this\r\nURL: https://docs.gitbook.com/_next/image?url=//example.com&w=1200&q=100\r\n- even though we have configured `remotePatterns` to protect against it.\r\n\r\nI originally went into the problem wanting to handle the URL properly\r\n(treating it as an absolute URL and potentially using the protocol of\r\nthe Optimization API itself as the relative protocol), but after seeing\r\nthe code in\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/client/legacy/image.tsx#L135\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/shared/lib/image-loader.ts#L26\r\n\r\nit feels that protocol-relative URLs are just not really supported\r\nanywhere. My understanding is that very few uses of `next/image` will be\r\nallowed to use protocol-relative URLs, so the impact of this breaking\r\nchange should be quite low? If others disagree I am happy to modify and\r\nto use the protocol of the request as a stand-in for the relative\r\nprotocol.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Steven <steven@ceriously.com>"},"active_lock_reason":"resolved"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65751","id":1869496175,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5vbj9v","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65751","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65751.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65751.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65751","number":65751,"state":"closed","locked":true,"title":"Remove process auto polyfill in edge runtime","user":{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"### What\r\n\r\nDisable auto polyfill for process in edge runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nReact uses process.emit behind a typeof guard now.

What\r\n\r\nRemove `missingSuspenseWithCSRBailout` and always treate the conditions where it was used as `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nThis was an intended behavior introduced in 14.1, which requires users to always add suspense boundaries if it's using any hook that could bail out to client rendering. `missingSuspenseWithCSRBailout` as `true` was the default behavior and you could disable it with `missingSuspenseWithCSRBailout: false` in next config. Now after the removal you will not be able to opt-out

PR ensures that any arbitrary binary data can be passed across the RSC boundary, especially when inlined in HTML. While the Flight payloads in RSC requests (`text/x-component`) already work, it's a different case when we inline them directly in HTML as that's required to be a valid string in UTF-8.\r\n\r\nSo instead of always inlining the UTF-8 decoded chunk (`new TextDecoder('utf-8')`), we fallback non-decodable chunks to base64 and send as a special item in `__next_f` so we can safely change it back to a binary typed array.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-12T19:12:58Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T00:04:24Z","closed_at":"2024-05-15T22:30:46Z","merged_at":"2024-05-15T22:30:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"a34d9098779f8a144627098478d7fbbc50dd99c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"feedthejim","id":11064311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY0MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11064311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim","html_url":"https://github.com/feedthejim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feedthejim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"wyattjoh","id":633002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh","html_url":"https://github.com/wyattjoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wyattjoh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"sebmarkbage","id":63648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage","html_url":"https://github.com/sebmarkbage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebmarkbage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js

especially when inlined in HTML. While the Flight payloads\r\nin RSC requests (`text/x-component`) already work, it's a different case\r\nwhen we inline them directly in HTML as that's required to be a valid\r\nstring in UTF-8.\r\n\r\nSo instead of always inlining the UTF-8 decoded chunk (`new\r\nTextDecoder('utf-8')`), we fallback non-decodable chunks to base64 and\r\nsend as a special item in `__next_f` so we can safely change it back to\r\na binary typed array.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: JJ Kasper

BREAKING CHANGE\r\n\r\nThis changes the behavior of the default image `loader` so that [`Content-Disposition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition#as_a_response_header_for_the_main_body) header is now `attachment` for added protection since the API can serve arbitrary remote images.\r\n\r\nThe new default value, `attachment`, forces the browser to download the image when visiting directly. This is particularly important when `dangerouslyAllowSVG` is true. Most users will not notice the change since visiting pages won't behave any differently, only visiting images directly.\r\n\r\nUsers can switch back to the old behavior by configuring `inline` in next.config.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  images: {\r\n    contentDispositionType: 'inline',\r\n

pull request includes a new buffered transform stream function and associated tests. The `createBufferedTransformStream` function returns a TransformStream that buffers input chunks across rendering boundaries. This function and the test cases for it appear in `stream-utils.node.ts` and `stream-utils.node.test.tsx` respectively. This change will help improve the stream processing capabilities in Next.js

a server action performs a redirect, we send an RSC request to the redirect URL so that everything can be handled in a single roundtrip.\r\n\r\nHowever, we forward the `next-action` header to that request. This means that the intra-app RSC request will be incorrectly associated with an action, and any rewrites we do for `next-action` requests (such as the work in the Next.js builder to ensure actions are routed to streaming outputs) won't be handled correctly. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What\r\n\r\nEnsures `nonce` is added to script and link tags Next.js renders. Additional cases it now handles:\r\n\r\n- We already passed `nonce` to the React rendering, though not consistently on all cases where `renderToStream` is called, I'm surprised there haven't been more reports of this, but now it will pass it on all cases where React rendering is called that I could find\r\n- In `get-layer-assets.tsx` we now pass `nonce` to both the `script` and `link` tags\r\n- When calling `ReactDOM.preload` the nonce was missing as well, ensured that the nonce is included in that case as well.\r\n\r\nAdded a test that mimicks the reproduction by adding `next/font` in this case.\r\n\r\nFixes #64037\r\nCloses PACK-2973  \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What\r\n\r\nRemove the auto appending `.xml` extension to the sitemap routes when it's a dynamic route.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nPreviously we were adding `.xml` to `/[...paths/]sitemap` routes, but the bad part is when you use it to generate multiple sitemaps with `generateSitemaps` in format like `/[...paths/]sitemap.xml/[id]`, which doesn't look good in url format and it can be inferred as xml with content-type. Hence we don't need to add `.xml` in the url.\r\n\r\nBefore this change it could also result into the different url between dev and prod:\r\ndev: `/sitemap.xml/[id]`\r\nprod: `/sitemap/[id].xml` \r\n\r\nNow it's going to be aligned as `/sitemap/[id]`.

What\r\n\r\nFollow up for #64294 where we could preload all the JS and CSS chunks for `next/dynamic` component.\r\n\r\n* Rename `preload-css` component to `preload-chunks` and remove the filter for css chunks\r\n* Preload JS chunks with `defer`\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nPreloading all the async chunks of `next/dynamic` can make rendering more efficiently when combined with the initial chunks. Since those chunks are splitted on client but still essential for the page\r\n\r\n#### After vs Before\r\n\r\nWe can see the waterfall starts much earlier for the dynamic chunk
