What?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an experimental option `clientTraceMetadata` that will use the existing OpenTelemetry functionality to propagate conventional OpenTelemetry trace information to the client.\r\n\r\nThe propagation metadata is propagated to the client via meta tags, having a `name` and a `content` attribute containing the value of the tracing value:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<html>\r\n    <head>\r\n        <meta name=\"baggage\" content=\"key1=val1,key2=val2\">\r\n        <meta name=\"traceparent\" content=\"00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01\">\r\n        <meta name=\"custom\" content=\"foobar\">\r\n    </head>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementation adheres to OpenTelemetry as much as possible, treating the meta tags as if they were tracing headers on outgoing requests. The `clientTraceMetadata` will contain the keys of the metadata that're going to injected for tracing purpose.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nTelemetry providers usually want to provide visibility across the entire stack, meaning it is useful for users to be able to associate, for example, web vitals on the client, with a span tree on the server. In order to be able to correlate tracing events from the front- and backend, it is necessary to share something like a trace ID or similar, that the telemetry providers can pick up and stitch back together to create a trace.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThe tracer was extended with a method `getTracePropagationData()` that returns the propagation data on the currently active OpenTelemetry context. \r\nWe are using `makeGetServerInsertedHTML()` to inject the meta tags into the HTML head for dynamic requests.\r\nThe meta tags are generated through using the newly added `getTracePropagationData()` method on the tracer.\r\n\r\nIt is important to mention that **the trace information should only be propagated for the initial loading of the page, including hard navigations**. Any subsequent operations should not propagate trace data from the server to the client, as the client generally is the root of the trace. The exception is initial pageloads, since while the request starts on the client, no JS has had the opportunity to run yet, meaning there is no trace propagation on the client before the server hasn't responded.\r\n\r\nSituations that we do not want tracing information to be propagated from the server to the client:\r\n- _Prefetch requests._ Prefetches generally start on the client and are already instrumented.\r\n- _Any sort of static precomputation, including PPR._ If we include trace information in static pages, it means that all clients that will land on the static page will be part of the \"precomputation\" trace. This would lead to gigantic traces with a ton of unrelated data that is not useful. The special case is dev mode where it is likely fine to propagate trace information, even for static content, since it is usually not actually static in dev mode.\r\n- _Clientside (soft) navigations._ Navigations start on the client and are usually already instrumented.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAn implementation that purely lives in user-land could have been implemented with `useServerInsertedHTML()`, however, that implementation would be cumbersome for users to set up, since the implementation of tracing would have to happen in a) the instrumentation hook, b) in a client-component that is used in a top-level layout.\r\n\r\n### Related issues/discussions\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/47660\r\n-

I'm not sure how far back Next.js support goes but it feels fine to me.\r\n\r\nI successfully tested some rules locally with ESLint 9.0.0 and this `eslint.config.js` (flat config format):\r\n```js\r\nimport js from '@eslint/js';\r\nimport nextPlugin from '@next/eslint-plugin-next';\r\nimport prettierRecommended from 'eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended';\r\nimport importSortPlugin from 'eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort';\r\nimport globals from 'globals';\r\nimport tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * TypeScript config with strict type checking and no type checking for JS files.\r\n */\r\nconst typeScriptConfig = [\r\n  ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,\r\n  {\r\n    plugins: {\r\n      '@typescript-eslint': tseslint.plugin,\r\n    },\r\n    languageOptions: {\r\n      parser: tseslint.parser,\r\n      parserOptions: {\r\n        project: true,\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    // disable type-aware linting on JS files\r\n    files: ['**/*.js', '**/*.mjs', '**/*.cjs'],\r\n    ...tseslint.configs.disableTypeChecked,\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Next.js config with recommended and core web vitals rules.\r\n */\r\nconst nextConfig = {\r\n  plugins: {\r\n    '@next/next': nextPlugin,\r\n  },\r\n  rules: {\r\n    ...nextPlugin.configs.recommended.rules,\r\n    ...nextPlugin.configs['core-web-vitals'].rules,\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Import sort config with simple-import-sort plugin.\r\n */\r\nconst importSortConfig = {\r\n  plugins: {\r\n    'simple-import-sort': importSortPlugin,\r\n  },\r\n  rules: {\r\n    'simple-import-sort/imports': 'error',\r\n    'simple-import-sort/exports': 'error',\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The final ESLint config wrapped with the tseslint.config helper for type hinting.\r\n */\r\nexport default tseslint.config(\r\n  {\r\n    ignores: ['.next', '.yarn', '**/*.d.ts', 'node_modules'],\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    languageOptions: {\r\n      globals: {\r\n        ...globals.browser,\r\n        ...globals.node,\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  js.configs.recommended,\r\n  ...typeScriptConfig,\r\n  nextConfig,\r\n  prettierRecommended,\r\n  importSortConfig,\r\n);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has a few more configs but I'm sure you can remove most of them. The important one is the `nextConfig`. Also important: Run `eslint` and not `next lint`, it's currently not compatible with the new flat config format.\r\n\r\nRelated discussion:

What\r\nWhen submitting a server action on a page that doesn't import the action handler, a \"Failed to find server action\" error is thrown, even if there's a valid handler for it elsewhere.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWorkers for a particular server action ID are keyed by their page entrypoints, and the client router invokes the current page when triggering a server action, since it assumes it's available on the current page. If an action is invoked after the router has moved away from a page that can handle the action, then the action wouldn't run and an error would be thrown in the server console.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nWe try to find a valid worker to forward the action to, if one exists. Otherwise it'll fallback to the usual error handling. This also adds a header to opt out of rendering the flight tree, as if the action calls a `revalidate` API, then it'll return a React tree corresponding with the wrong page. \r\n\r\nFixes

the `detectContentType` function could invocate `Array.prototype.every` over the initial few bytes of the buffer multiple times before determining its content type. In the worst-case scenario, if a non-image file was inadvertently passed to the `imageOptimizer` function, the first few bytes would be invoked by `Array.prototype.every` up to seven times before `detectContentType` acknowledges that it's not a known image type.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by adding an additional check for the first byte.

Current semantics of `dynamic = \"force-dynamic\"` will still treat the fetch as cacheable unless explicitly overriding it in the fetch, or setting a segment level `fetchCache`. \r\n\r\nThe `dynamic` cache configuration should be seen as a \"top-level\" configuration, while more fine-grained controls should inherit logical defaults from the top-level. Otherwise this forces people to opt-into the `fetchCache` configuration, or manually override each `fetch` call, which isn't what you'd expect when forcing a segment to be dynamic.\r\n\r\nThis will default to not attempting to cache the fetch when `force-dynamic` is used. As a result, I had to update one of the `app-static` tests to use `revalidate: 0` rather than `force-dynamic`, as the revalidate behavior is slightly different in that it won't modify the revalidation time on a fetch if it's non-zero.\r\n\r\nCloses

Current semantics\r\nof `dynamic = \"force-dynamic\"` will still treat the fetch as cacheable\r\nunless explicitly overriding it in the fetch, or setting a segment level\r\n`fetchCache`.\r\n\r\nThe `dynamic` cache configuration should be seen as a \"top-level\"\r\nconfiguration, while more fine-grained controls should inherit logical\r\ndefaults from the top-level. Otherwise this forces people to opt-into\r\nthe `fetchCache` configuration, or manually override each `fetch` call,\r\nwhich isn't what you'd expect when forcing a segment to be dynamic.\r\n\r\nThis will default to not attempting to cache the fetch when\r\n`force-dynamic` is used. As a result, I had to update one of the\r\n`app-static` tests to use `revalidate: 0` rather than `force-dynamic`,\r\nas the revalidate behavior is slightly different in that it won't modify\r\nthe

What\r\n\r\nWe introduced a new algorithm to find the matched hydration error tags, when there're two tags indicating children and parent as bad descendence relationship. Now we search for the child first from the last index, and then from found child to search its above parent. This way we can find the two related tags in O(1), since they could be not directly nested.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nWhen a hydration error occurred, such as bad nesting `div` under `p`,  one of the tag `div` is matched multiple times in the component stack, it shouldn't be highlighted multiple times. This PR fixes the bad matching about multiple nested tags, e.g. when there're many `div` tag and `div` is one of the bad tag, only the one directly under p should be highlited.\r\n\r\nCase\r\n```\r\nPage > div > div > p > div\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent Result: all `div` and `p` get highlighted, `[]` represents highlighted.\r\n```\r\nPage > [div] > [div] > [p] > [div]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected: only the related 2 tags are highlighted, `[]` represents highlighted.\r\n```\r\nPage > div > div > [p] > [div]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks @JohnPhamous for reporting the issue\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses

What?\n\nWhen creating the Next.js instance fails for whatever reason (most commonly `next build` failing) it currently exits the process, this causes Jest to not report these tests as failed.\n\nThe change in this PR ensures that anytime creating the instance fails it throws an error that is caught by Jest and then causes Jest to report the tests as failed.\n\nThe reporting of tests is relevant as our monitoring tools (i.e. DataDog / Turbopack test manifest) rely on correct reporting of all failing tests.\n\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Thanks for opening a PR! Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n## For Contributors\r\n\r\n### Improving Documentation\r\n\r\n- Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to fix formatting issues before opening the PR.\r\n- Read the Docs Contribution Guide to ensure your contribution follows the docs guidelines: https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide\r\n\r\n### Adding or Updating Examples\r\n\r\n- The \"examples guidelines\" are followed from our contributing doc https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/examples/adding-examples.md\r\n- Make sure the linting passes by running `pnpm build && pnpm lint`. See https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/repository/linting.md\r\n\r\n### Fixing a bug\r\n\r\n- Related issues linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- Tests added. See: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n### Adding a feature\r\n\r\n- Implements an existing feature request or RFC. Make sure the feature request has been accepted for implementation before opening a PR. (A discussion must be opened, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas)\r\n- Related issues/discussions are linked using `fixes #number`\r\n- e2e tests added (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/testing.md#writing-tests-for-nextjs)\r\n- Documentation added\r\n- Telemetry added. In case of a feature if it's used or not.\r\n- Errors have a helpful link attached, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## For Maintainers\r\n\r\n- Minimal description (aim for explaining to someone not on the team to understand the PR)\r\n- When linking to a Slack thread, you might want to share details of the conclusion\r\n- Link both the Linear (Fixes NEXT-xxx) and the GitHub issues\r\n- Add review comments if necessary to explain to the reviewer the logic behind a change\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\nPrimarily, this is fixing the code highlighted here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/073cd74433146d6d3849110e7dada92351ebb7d4/packages/next/src/server/lib/patch-fetch.ts#L228-L230\r\n\r\nAs `(fetch as any).__nextGetStaticStore?.()` returns `StaticGenerationAsyncStorage | undefined`, and not `StaticGenerationStore`. A call to `.getStore()` as the previous line does corrects this issue.\r\n\r\nSecondarily, this improves the `as any` type access being done on the patched fetch object to make it more type safe and easier to work with. Since this was added, some features like the `.external` files were added that allowed files to import the correct async local storage object in client and server environments correctly to allow for direct access. Code across Next.js no-longer uses this mechanism to access the storage, and instead relies on this special treated import.\r\n\r\nTypes were improved within the `patch-fetch.ts` file to allow for safer property access by adding consistent types and guards.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nWithout this change, checks like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/073cd74433146d6d3849110e7dada92351ebb7d4/packages/next/src/server/lib/patch-fetch.ts#L246\r\n\r\nAlways fail, because when `(fetch as any).__nextGetStaticStore?.()` returns `StaticGenerationAsyncStorage`, it isn't the actual store, so the type is wrong.\r\n\r\nCloses

adding refresh markers for refetching segments that are \"stale\" (the soft navigation case where they are still in the Router State Tree but not part of the page that we're rendering), they only contained a reference to the pathname. Once the actual refresh was triggered we added the current search params to the request.\r\n\r\nHowever, this causes an issue: segments in the `FlightRouterState` can contain searchParams (ie, `__PAGE__?{\"foo\": \"bar}` is what the segment becomes when adding `?foo=bar` to a page). This means that when we refresh those nodes from the server, it won't know how to find the `CacheNode` for the stale segment since we won't have them in the refetch tree. This updates to keep a reference to the searchParams that were part of the request that made it active. \r\n\r\nWhile fixing this, I also noticed that we were missing a spot to add the refetch marker in `applyRouterStatePatchToTree` in the case of a root refresh (caught by these tests failing in PPR)\r\n\r\n[x-ref](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/63900#discussioncomment-9002137)\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

refreshing inactive segments that contained searchParams (#64086)","commit_message":"When adding refresh markers for refetching segments that are \"stale\"\r\n(the soft navigation case where they are still in the Router State Tree\r\nbut not part of the page that we're rendering), they only contained a\r\nreference to the pathname. Once the actual refresh was triggered we\r\nadded the current search params to the request.\r\n\r\nHowever, this causes an issue: segments in the `FlightRouterState` can\r\ncontain searchParams (ie, `__PAGE__?{\"foo\": \"bar}` is what the segment\r\nbecomes when adding `?foo=bar` to a page). This means that when we\r\nrefresh those nodes from the server, it won't know how to find the\r\n`CacheNode` for the stale segment since we won't have them in the\r\nrefetch tree. This updates to keep a reference to the searchParams that\r\nwere part of the request that made it active.\r\n\r\nWhile fixing this, I also noticed that we were missing a spot to add the\r\nrefetch marker in `applyRouterStatePatchToTree` in the case of a root\r\nrefresh (caught by these tests failing in PPR)\r\n\r\n\r\n[x-ref](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/63900#discussioncomment-9002137)\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What?\r\n\r\nBuilds on #64071, this fixes the tests that started failing after the tests isolation was enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe tests that are upgraded in this PR are likely in need of a refactor, since they rely on the artifacts of a previous test.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nIf the refactor was simple, I just did it (eg.: removing manually `await next.start()` and `await next.stop()` calls), otherwise I just disabled this via the `skipTestsIsolation: true` flag on tests, that indicates those test need a refactor in the future (in a separate PR). \r\n\r\n_NOTE to reviewer: Hide whitespace changes while reviewing, since some tests are updated as well to use `nextTestSetup` instead of the now deprecated `createNextDescribe`_. The actual changes are much fewer.\r\n\r\nCloses

docs make a distinction between prefetch behavior based on static/dynamic data but this is not how it's implemented.
