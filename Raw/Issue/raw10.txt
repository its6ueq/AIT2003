Click on either of the Toggle buttons \r\n\r\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\r\n\r\n## Click `Toggle (Modal Opens After Delay)`\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\n1.

I expected the Photo Grid to still be visible (since a `default.tsx` is present)\r\n4. Since the server action was started _before_ the navigation event, I would expect the Modal to open with either the stale or current value (a race, depending on the time it took the server action to update), but to have it ultimately settle on the latest value once the server action revalidation is completed.\r\n\r\n### Provide environment information\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: linux\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu, 11 Apr 2024 01:47:33 +0000\r\n  Available memory (MB): 31886\r\n  Available CPU cores: 8\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 18.18.2\r\n  npm: 10.5.2\r\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\r\n  pnpm: 8.15.5\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.3.0-canary.5 // Latest available version is detected (14.3.0-canary.5).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which area(s) are affected?

We can't wait for the server action revalidation to complete if we want to maintain the nice UX that we get from `useOptimistic`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64585/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64584","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64584/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64584/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64584/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/64584","id":2246826374,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6F69mG","number":64584,"title":"router.refresh() causes 404 with basePath","user":{"login":"MarkusWendorf","id":18446907,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDQ2OTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18446907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkusWendorf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusWendorf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2471906168,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDcxOTA2MTY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fddf99","default":true,"description":"Issue was opened via the bug report template."},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2024-04-16T20:23:59Z","updated_at":"2024-05-01T12:02:00Z","closed_at":"2024-04-17T01:01:47Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":"resolved","body":"### Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/MarkusWendorf/rsc-bug\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. npm run dev\r\n2. go to http://localhost:3000/path\r\n3. press \"Refresh\" button\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nAfter pressing \"Refresh\" you can see 2 rsc requests:\r\n- 1 with basePath\r\n- 1 without basePath (causing a 404)\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- 1 request without a 404\r\n\r\n<img width=\"441\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 22 22 46\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/18446907/8a04b308-c332-45bc-a53f-2f79f5ea6227\">\r\n\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: arm64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 23.3.0: Wed Dec 20 21:30:44 PST 2023; root:xnu-10002.81.5~7/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\r\n  Available memory (MB): 32768\r\n  Available CPU cores: 10\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.9.0\r\n  npm: 10.1.0\r\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\r\n  pnpm: 8.15.4\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.1 // Latest available version is detected (14.2.1).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

`AppRouterState` is promise-based (so we can `use` the values and suspend in render), the state itself isn't stable between renders. Each action corresponds with a new Promise object. When a link is hovered, a prefetch action is dispatched, even if the prefetch never happens (for example, if there's already a prefetch entry in the cache, and it doesn't need to prefetch again). In other words, the prefetch action will be dispatched but won't necessarily change the state.\r\n\r\nThis means that these no-op actions that don't actually change the state values will trigger a re-render. Most of the context providers in `AppRouter` are memoized with the exception of `LayoutRouter` context. This PR memoizes those values so that consumers are only notified of meaningful updates.\r\n\r\nFixes #63159\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-3127","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64575/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64575/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64572","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64572/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64572/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64572/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64572","id":2246523458,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5s1FCN","number":64572,"title":"add CI config","user":{"login":"arlyon","id":8715352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MTUzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8715352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon","html_url":"https://github.com/arlyon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlyon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2024-04-16T17:06:58Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T12:02:58Z","closed_at":"2024-04-17T13:05:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/64572","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64572","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64572.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64572.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

I received a not found error and nothing useful in the logs. Ideally it would 'just work' as expected without the need of a special catch conditional to throw. If that's not possible then an error message of some kind would be helpful. If that's not possible then make sure it's well covered across all docs that talk about redirecting. An example of how to use it within a try catch would be helpful as well rather than advising to not do it.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing it would throw if it's an internal path and next can tell that it does not exist. Also guessing the typescript def can't easily tell what's an internal path string vs an external url. Hopefully a dev mode error when not catching & throwing is possible and give developers a clue as to what's going on.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nhttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers#redirects\r\n\r\nquote from leerob on the original issue below.\r\n\r\n\r\n              This is intended – `redirect()` throws `NEXT_REDIRECT` and returns the TypeScript `never` type. It should be called outside of your try/catch block, or handled explicitly. We've updated the docs to change the code blocks for Server Actions to place the `redirect()` after the try/catch block.\r\n\r\nhttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#redirecting\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @leerob in https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/55586#issuecomment-1869024539_\r\n            ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64539/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64538","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64538/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64538/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64538/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/64538","id":2245018913,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6F0EUh","number":64538,"title":"router.relace when shallow be ture will modify the state of history","user":{"login":"taowensheng1997","id":49777542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzc3NTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49777542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997","html_url":"https://github.com/taowensheng1997","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taowensheng1997/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2471906168,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDcxOTA2MTY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fddf99","default":true,"description":"Issue was opened via the bug report template."},{"id":5907879217,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABYCMVMQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/invalid%20link","name":"invalid link","color":"444444","default":false,"description":"The issue was auto-closed due to a missing/invalid reproduction link.

We refresh because it's possible that the discarded action triggered some sort of mutation/revalidation, and we want the router to still be able to respond to that new data. \r\n\r\nHowever there's a bug in this logic -- it'll only enqueue the refresh action if there were no other actions in the queue, ignoring the case where something is still in the queue. This makes sure that the refresh is handled after `runRemainingActions` finishes. \r\n\r\nWhen adding a test for the server component case (which doesn't hit this refresh branch), I noticed `LayoutRouter` caused React to suspend indefinitely, because it got stuck in the `use(unresolvedThenable)` case. We should only suspend indefinitely if we kicked off a the `SERVER_PATCH` action, as otherwise it's possible nothing will ever break out of that branch. \r\n\r\nFixes #64517\r\nFixes #64535\r\nCloses

`src/compiled`.\r\n- Load React source maps via `source-map-loader` during webpack build.\r\n- Inline Next.js sources contents into source map files to avoid `loadNetworkResource` error in Chrome DevTools.\r\n- Adjust vscode launch configurations.\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- Hopefully this does not interfere with your current work on React prod builds / source maps, @acdlite?\r\n- Unfortunately, the source maps are not applied in the DevTools Performance panel. [I'm not sure yet](https://x.com/unstubbable/status/1779925144351252581), whether this is something we can fix, or whether it's a DevTools limitation when profiling a Node.js app. It does work when profiling client-side code.\r\n- I've checked that https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/vscode-debugger.md is still

slot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64517/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64516","id":2244300738,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5stdTo","number":64516,"title":"Revert

For that reason, the setting did not work at all. This works only in production mode.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tried to implement a test in `/test/production/custom-server` but I failed to get the `stderr` messages. When someone give me some guidance, I will add a new test.\r\n\r\nHere are some criteria:\r\n\r\n- need: custom server with `quiet: true` setting\r\n- need: a next.js page with thrown error. e.g. `export const getServerSideProps = () => { throw new Error('failed') }`\r\n- need: collect all `stderr` messages\r\n\r\nI tested the fix in our project by editing the files in `node_modules` -- it worked.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nWe upgrade our project from next `13.3.4` to `14.2.0` and saw this regression. I can not tell in which version this bug was added. We run a Next.js + 'custom server' + Docker setup. Because we have a lot of traffic, we need to suppress the standard Next.js logging and using our own logging.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Sometimes, the WordPress API returns an invalid format, resulting in a 404 error on the Next.js side. After a successful cache validation, the content displays correctly but with a 404 error code, which adversely affects SEO.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick demo with screenshots\r\n1.

Clone the above three Next.js app repositories locally.\r\n2. Install npm packages on all apps.\r\n3. First, run both child apps, ensuring they are running successfully before starting the root app.\r\n4. After running the root app open the URL of the root app in a web browser.\r\n5. You will notice that the primary colour of the buttons is applied from the theme configuration on the Home page (root app component). However, when navigating to the Services or About Us pages, the buttons display with the default primary colour of Antd instead of the configured theme's primary colour.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nWhat is expected?\r\nNext.js v14x and @module-federation/nextjs-mf v8.x. With this configuration, Antd theme changes should work correctly in both root and child Next.js apps.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually happening?\r\nWhen using Next.js v14.x along with @module-federation/nextjs-mf v8.x, I encountered an issue with the Ant Design (Antd) theme configuration. In this setup, the root Next.js app successfully provides the theme changes to child Next.js apps. However, while the root Next.js app consumes the theme changes, the child Next.js app only displays the default theme without incorporating the Antd theme changes.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I downgraded to Next.js version 13.4.7 and @module-federation/nextjs-mf v7.x. With this configuration, the Antd theme changes are functioning correctly on both the root and child Next.js apps\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\n| Environment | Info |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| antd | 5.15.4 |\r\n| nextjs | 14.1.4 |\r\n| React | 18 |\r\n| @module-federation/nextjs-mf | 8.1.0 |\r\n| System | Mac |\r\n| Browser | Chrome latest version |\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

If we only wanted to handle hello worlds, we could probably make this even faster but on production, a slow fetch call to your DB is probably what's slowing you down.\r\n\r\nI'll look into App Router next.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nI guess I got nerd-sniped into it 😃 \r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nA few optimizations:\r\n- I looked deeply at the pipeline for rendering a Pages Router page. I noticed a lot of intermediary streams being created here and there to eventually be concatenated to a simple string. I think this is probably left over code from when we wanted to support streaming there and so there's some code that was shared with the App Router, which we absolutely don't need I think. I refactored it to be slightly simpler with just a few string concats here and there.\r\n- misc: I removed some redundant Promises being created here and there and added a small inline optimisation to eliminate `if (renderOpts.dev)` code in production.\r\n\r\n### Nummies\r\n\r\nTest setup: hello world pages router app, next start + autocannon\r\n\r\n- requests handled in 10s: 18k  -> 33K, **~80% improvement**\r\n- avg latency: 4.89ms -> 2.8ms, **~42% improvement**\r\n- avg req/res: 1846.5 -> 2983.5, **~61% improvement**\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n\r\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/11064311/658e7ade-eba7-4604-a7c9-619bd51a5ec8\">\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\nafter\r\n\r\n<img width=\"880\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/11064311/2f46cf69-b788-4db2-bf90-6f65dc7abd82\">\r\n\r\nAlso ran on the other benchmark by @eknkc.

Rather than relying on manual environment checks only as the source with error-prone type casts, this adds basic guards (albeit naive) that assert the typings depending on the runtime environment variables. This greatly enhances the typings used across the servers as the servers no longer use the `as` keyword when working with these request and response types.\r\n\r\nThis is a precursor to future planned work to further split the different rendering runtimes to assist with code elimination and framework organization.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nAs a step to utilizing these more unified types, the `app-render.tsx` (App Pages rendering pipeline) has been modified to instead accept the abstract `BaseNextRequest` and `BaseNextResponse` types. This is a precursor to future work to split the streaming behaviour based on the runtime environment (ie, in Node.js, we can utilize the native streams instead of web streams, which offer significant performance gains).\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThe server types were modified to be generic, allowing the three server implementations to have their types flow safely between the different methods. This enables us to only reference the `NodeNextRequest` within the `NextNodeServer`, and the `WebNextRequest` within the `NextWebServer` for example.\r\n\r\n🎥 [Loom Video](https://www.loom.com/share/76af2225cf0246d0b4f609ab3e35fff9?sid=c948a919-ac9e-4571-8a75-bd9d0a0776e2)\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-3102","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64451","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64451/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64451/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64451/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64451","id":2241689549,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5sksbY","number":64451,"title":"Fix ASL bundling for dynamic css","user":{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"},{"id":4771244046,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABHGNoDg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/Turbopack","name":"Turbopack","color":"FF1E56","default":false,"description":"Related to Turbopack with Next.js."},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-04-13T18:30:52Z","updated_at":"2024-05-01T12:02:27Z","closed_at":"2024-04-17T08:18:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/64451","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64451","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64451.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64451.patch","merged_at":"2024-04-17T08:18:09Z"},"body":"### Why\r\n\r\nFor app page rendering on edge, the `AsyncLocalStorage` (ALS) should be bundled as same instance across layers. We're accessing the ALS in `next/dynamic` modules during SSR for preloading CSS chunks. There's a bug that we can't get the ALS store during SSR in edge, I digged into it and found the root cause is:\r\n\r\nWe have both import paths:\r\n`module (rsc layer) -> request ALS (shared layer)`\r\n`module (ssr layer) -> request ALS (shared layer)`\r\n\r\nWe expect the ALS to be the same module since we're using the same layer but found that they're treated as different modules due to applying another loader transform on ssr layer. They're resulted in the same `shared` layer, but with different resource queries. This PR excluded that transform so now they're identical across layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What\r\n\r\nFor webpack, we aligned the loaders applying to the async local storage, so that they're resolved as the same module now.\r\n\r\nFor turbopack, we leverage module transition, sort of creating a new `app-shared` layer for these modules, and apply the transition to all async local storage instances therefore the instances of them are only bundled once.\r\nTo make the turbopack chanegs work, we change how the async local storage modules defined, separate the instance into a single file and mark it as \"next-shared\" layer with import:\r\n\r\n```\r\nany module -> async local storage --- use transition, specify \"next-shared\" layer ---> async local storage instance\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-3085","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64451/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64449","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64449/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64449/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64449/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64449","id":2241643245,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5skjhJ","number":64449,"title":"router restore should take priority over pending actions","user":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-04-13T16:21:00Z","updated_at":"2024-04-28T12:01:59Z","closed_at":"2024-04-13T17:49:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/64449","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64449","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64449.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64449.patch","merged_at":"2024-04-13T17:49:58Z"},"body":"Since the router processes events sequentially, we special case `ACTION_NAVIGATE` events to \"discard\" a pending server action so that it can process the navigation with higher priority.

Create a project with a high level dynamic path such as `[locale]` that is used in most website that reach a certain size\r\n2. Use a localization library such as `next-intl` recommanded by nextjs\r\n3. setup a custom `not-found.js` page inside this `[locale]` folder to catch all the potential not found\r\n\r\nin my case:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useTranslations } from \"next-intl\"\r\nimport React, { Suspense } from \"react\"\r\n// IMPORT COMPONENTS\r\nimport NotFound from \"@components/error/Error\"\r\n\r\nconst NotFoundPage = () => {\r\n  // HOOKS\r\n  const t = useTranslations(\"error\")\r\n\r\n  // MAIN RENDER\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <title>{t(`error-page-title`)}</title>\r\n      <meta key=\"desc\" name=\"description\" content={t(`error-meta-desc`)} />\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<></>}>\r\n        <NotFound title={t(\"error-empty-title\", { error: 404 })} message={t(\"error-empty-message\")} label={t(\"error-empty-action\")} />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default NotFoundPage\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Setup a `loading.js` page also to handle streaming at the same level\r\n5. Enjoy the bug! The page show the correct `<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">` and correct UI but no `404` status code, just a `200` (you can see it here for example https://www.archsplace.com/whatever-not-found-page-u-fancy)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n6.

Navigate to deployed application: https://nextgram-sigma.vercel.app/\r\n2. Click a card to open a modal\r\n3. Press the \"Submit\" button (which triggers a server action with a 5 second sleep)\r\n4.

Instead, the URL bar updates immediately, but the modal itself stays open until the server action completes.\r\n\r\n### Provide environment information\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: linux\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri, 05 Apr 2024 00:14:23 +0000\r\n  Available memory (MB): 31886\r\n  Available CPU cores: 8\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 18.18.2\r\n  npm: 10.5.1\r\n  Yarn: 1.22.22\r\n  pnpm: 8.15.5\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.1-canary.3 // Latest available version is detected (14.2.1-canary.3).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which area(s) are affected?

server actions + modals, because the user gets the immediate feedback that the action succeeded and naturally tries to close the modal soon after, which results in the app \"hanging\" until the server action completes and the router can catch up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64432/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64432/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/64430","id":2241136833,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5si6CJ","number":64430,"title":"Update

Start up the app with Turbopack - `npm run dev:turbo` - note that it breaks\r\n\r\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTurbopack throws the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: createContext only works in Client Components. Add the \"use client\" directive at the top of the file to use it. Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/context-in-server-component\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, the component that uses `createContext` indeed has the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file, so this error should not be thrown.\r\n\r\n### Provide environment information\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: arm64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0: Mon Aug 22 20:19:52 PDT 2022; root:xnu-8020.140.49~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\r\n  Available memory (MB): 32768\r\n  Available CPU cores: 10\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.11.1\r\n  npm: 10.2.4\r\n  Yarn: 1.16.0\r\n  pnpm: 8.15.1\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.0 // Latest available version is detected (14.2.0).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.1.3\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which area(s) are affected?

After that, Turbopack now throws an error.\r\n\r\nRelease that breaks it:\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v14.2.0-canary.34\r\n\r\nIt might seem strange that we are importing client components in a request handler, BUT, the Payload config contains both server-side and client-side code, including custom React components. We need the Payload config within API routes in order to function, so, safely being able to disregard client components within route handlers is paramount to us.\r\n\r\nAlso of note, `useState` works fine in the `ClientComponent` included in this repro. It's just `createContext` that breaks Turbopack.
