Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/Huilensolis/next-js-bug-report\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. run the project on dev mode\r\n2. open in the browser\r\n3. click on \"go to slug\"\r\n4. open dev tools and go to the `Element` tab\r\n5. check the head children looking for one that looks like this:\r\n```HTML\r\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"http://localhost:3000/slug-value/opengraph-image?<image-id-here>\">\r\n```\r\n6. copy the value of the `content` attribute and open it on a new tab\r\n7. the browser won't show anything because the server did not return anything\r\n8. go to the code and open the `opengraph-image.tsx` file\r\n6. change the value of the style `justifyContent` to \"center\"\r\n```diff\r\nimport { ImageResponse } from \"next/og\";\r\n\r\n// Route segment config\r\nexport const runtime = \"edge\";\r\n\r\n// Image metadata\r\nexport const alt = \"Huilen Solis's Blog\";\r\nexport const size = {\r\n  width: 1200,\r\n  height: 630,\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const contentType = \"image/png\";\r\n\r\n// Image generation\r\nexport default async function Image({\r\n  params: { slug },\r\n}: {\r\n  params: { slug: string };\r\n}) {\r\n  return new ImageResponse(\r\n    (\r\n      <div\r\n        style={{\r\n          background: \"rgb(10 10 10 / 1)\",\r\n          color: \"rgb(250 250 250 / 1)\",\r\n          width: \"100%\",\r\n          height: \"100%\",\r\n          display: \"flex\",\r\n          alignItems: \"center\",\r\n--        justifyContent: \"start\",\r\n++        justifyContent: \"center\",\r\n          padding: \"2rem\",\r\n        }}\r\n      >\r\n        <h1 style={{ textAlign: \"start\", fontSize: \"5rem\" }}>{slug}</h1>\r\n      </div>\r\n    ),\r\n    // ImageResponse options\r\n    {\r\n      // For convenience, we can re-use the exported opengraph-image\r\n      // size config to also set the ImageResponse's width and height.\r\n      ...size,\r\n    },\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n7. now refresh the tab of `http://localhost:3000/slug-value/opengraph-image?<image-id-here>`\r\n8. now it works - because you changed the style\r\n\r\nnote: sometimes the server changes the open graph-image param between renders or changes, so be careful not to look at an old link with an old image id. check the meta element from the page dom tree head before navigating to the open graph image again. the \n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nit should  not crash if the styles are different than the example provided on the next js documentation\n\n###

The default `maxLength` of 3 (even up to 7) that the plugin is using may yield conflicts in assigned module IDs when building a Next.js app. In this case, Webpack would fall back to assigning unhashed IDs, thus creating non-deterministic bundles. To prevent this, we increase the ID space size to 8 digits. Additionally, we fail on module ID conflicts in test mode to catch any regressions.\r\n\r\nNote: This does have the small disadvantage that the bundle sizes increase slightly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66298","id":2322023855,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5w0Qel","number":66298,"title":"Reapply

me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66258/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66253","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66253/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66253/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66253/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66253","id":2319740260,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5wsftk","number":66253,"title":"Update

This was more apparent when PPR was enabled as it was mixing dynamic + static rendering in development which propagated to errors. This change ensures that requests that are made with `RSC: 1` are not marked as `/_next/data` URL's, and don't use the same logic paths.\r\n\r\nPreviously it was a bit confusing because we used the variable `isDataReq` in a few places that made it hard to tell what it was referring to. In this case, the `isDataReq` is actually only used by the pages router. This renames the `isDataReq` to `isNextDataRequest` to make it clearer, as well as refactors to ensure that it's not used in the paths for app routes.\r\n\r\nAlso to better represent the rendering modes the `supportsDynamicHTML` variable was renamed to `supportsDynamicResponse`.\r\n\r\nFixes #66241 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66249/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66248","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66248/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66248/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66248/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/66248","id":2319376170,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6KPt8q","number":66248,"title":"Incorrect XML Namespace in sitemap.ts for Next.js 14.2","user":{"login":"xoocode","id":85336461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MzM2NDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85336461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode","html_url":"https://github.com/xoocode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoocode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2471906168,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDcxOTA2MTY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fddf99","default":true,"description":"Issue was opened via the bug report template."},{"id":3555293326,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis7T6XiO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/Metadata","name":"Metadata","color":"CEC038","default":false,"description":"Related to Next.js' Metadata API."}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2024-05-27T15:15:02Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T20:19:35Z","closed_at":"2024-05-29T20:19:35Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Link to the code that reproduces this issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xoocode/next-sitemap-namespace-example\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository.\r\n2. Build the project.\r\n3. Visit `localhost:3000/sitemap.xml` in a Chrome browser.\r\n4. The browser will not render the XML correctly.\r\n\r\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCurrent Behavior:\r\nThe sitemap.xml file generated by Next.js 14.2 contains incorrect namespace declarations. Specifically, the namespace for xhtml:link is defined as `xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"`, causing the XML to render incorrectly in Chrome. Apparently [http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml](url) does not include the xhtml:link definition.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nThe sitemap.xml file should contain the correct namespace declaration for xhtml:link, allowing the XML to render correctly in browsers. The correct namespace should be `xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/xhtml11_schema.html\"`.\r\n\r\n### Provide environment information\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: win32\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: Windows 11 Home\r\n  Available memory (MB): 65193\r\n  Available CPU cores: 20\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.13.1\r\n  npm: N/A\r\n  Yarn: N/A\r\n  pnpm: N/A\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.3 // Latest available version is detected (14.2.3).\r\n  eslint-config-next: 14.2.3\r\n  react: 18.3.1\r\n  react-dom: 18.3.1\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which area(s) are affected?

I could create a few follow-up PRs to land those migrations if there's interest.\r\n\r\nNote: I've integrated the contents of `tsconfig.base.json` into the root `tsconfig.json` since this was now the only one extending from it.

What is the update you wish to see?\n\nI am experiencing an issue with the sitemap generation using the alternates key for localized URLs. \r\n\r\nhere is the link : https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nThe generated XML does not reflect the expected format when alternates are included. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I remove the alternates key, the sitemap is generated correctly.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n- Use Next.js version ^14.2.3.\r\n- Implement the sitemap generation with alternates as shown in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Here is the code used:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n\r\nimport { MetadataRoute } from 'next';\r\n\r\nexport default function sitemap(): MetadataRoute.Sitemap {\r\n  return [\r\n    {\r\n      url: 'https://acme.com',\r\n      lastModified: new Date(),\r\n      alternates: {\r\n        languages: {\r\n          es: 'https://acme.com/es',\r\n          de: 'https://acme.com/de',\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      url: 'https://acme.com/about',\r\n      lastModified: new Date(),\r\n      alternates: {\r\n        languages: {\r\n          es: 'https://acme.com/es/about',\r\n          de: 'https://acme.com/de/about',\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      url: 'https://acme.com/blog',\r\n      lastModified: new Date(),\r\n      alternates: {\r\n        languages: {\r\n          es: 'https://acme.com/es/blog',\r\n          de: 'https://acme.com/de/blog',\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  ];\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe generated XML sitemap should correctly reflect the alternate language URLs.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe XML sitemap does not format the alternate language URLs as expected. Instead, it shows an incorrect structure.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nWith alternates (incorrect format):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/76095902/3f1cd574-6974-41b5-a870-22d63f467a64)\r\n\r\nWithout alternates (correct format):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/76095902/1bb76b58-29bf-48fa-8b3a-173c29d45cac)\r\n\r\nSystem information\r\n\r\nOS: Windows\r\nBrowser: Chrome\r\nVersion of Next.js: 14.2.3\r\nVersion of Node.js: 21.7.1\r\n\r\nAdditional context :\r\n\r\nI am unsure whether this is a bug in the implementation or a documentation issue. Please advise if there is an alternative way to achieve the correct sitemap structure with alternates or if this feature can be improved.\r\n\n\n### Does the docs page already exist?

When I opened the PR the tests were passing and only a single `POST` request was being made with all relevant data being shipped within that single request, but shortly after a change was landed which introduced this second request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66162","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66162/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66162/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66162/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/66162","id":2314609661,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6J9iP9","number":66162,"title":"Turbopack error on edge runtime(middleware): `Error [TypeError]: _react.default.createContext is not a function`","user":{"login":"chungweileong94","id":15154097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTU0MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15154097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94","html_url":"https://github.com/chungweileong94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chungweileong94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2471906168,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDcxOTA2MTY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fddf99","default":true,"description":"Issue was opened via the bug report template."},{"id":4771244046,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABHGNoDg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/Turbopack","name":"Turbopack","color":"FF1E56","default":false,"description":"Related to Turbopack with Next.js."},{"id":5484123250,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABRuEUcg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/linear:%20turbopack","name":"linear: turbopack","color":"290F77","default":false,"description":"Confirmed issue that is tracked by the Turbopack team."}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2024-05-24T07:16:11Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T06:36:23Z","closed_at":"2024-05-24T15:39:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":"off-topic","body":"### Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/chungweileong94/turbopack-edge-error-bug\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1.
