running nextjs canary version 7 it will work, however newer version of canary have introduced an optional sharp dependency that does not resolve correctly with these package managers and will not work.\r\n\r\nSo to be clear, change the `package.json` dependency to canary.34 for next and it will break after installing dependencies again.\r\n\r\nI see this issue happen with yarn v1 and pnpm v8

However, it didn't land in react@18.3.0 and it is expected to land in react@19.0.0 due to the breaking change.\r\n\r\nThis means that users upgrading to react@18.3.0 will see a warning.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to stop looking at the `React.version` string and instead check for `React.use`, a feature that [will land in react@19.0.0](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19#new-feature-use) but is also available in react@canary and react@beta today.\r\n\r\nNote: There were tests added for App Router and Pages Router in a previous PR https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/47302 but they seem to run on react@18.2.0 which is why we don't see failures.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/65161\r\n\r\nRelated

What?\r\n\r\nInitially added `@node-rs/argon2` to the list as `argon2` was already in the list to make the provided reproduction pass, however, when digging deeper into Lucia I found that `oslo` also uses `@node-rs/bcrypt`. \r\n\r\nI also looked at Lucia example [1](https://github.com/lucia-auth/examples/blob/main/nextjs-app/username-and-password/next.config.js#L2-L6) and [2](https://github.com/lucia-auth/examples/blob/main/nextjs-app/username-and-password/next.config.js#L2-L6) which show that this configuration is always added: `serverComponentsExternalPackages: [\"oslo\"]`.\r\n\r\nThat shouldn't be needed as we keep a list of packages that can't be bundled in Next.js itself, so I've updated the list to add `oslo`, `@node-rs/argon2`, and `@node-rs/bcrypt`. \r\n\r\nThis makes it so that you don't have to add additional configuration to use Lucia.\r\n\r\nFixes #63850\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

What?\r\n\r\nEnsures just importing `crypto` does not error, only when it is used it shows an error in the edge runtime.

Even in that case `punycode`, `process`, `querystring`, and `string_decorder` get polyfilled regardless, this causes the newly added test to fail.\r\n\r\nRemoving the polyfills would be potentially breaking so we'll want to change it in Next.js 15 instead.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

There is people who can answer this better than I can over there, since this is a rather tricky use case.\r\n\r\nAll you need is a middleware that does this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from \"next/server\";\r\n\r\nexport function middleware(req: NextRequest) {\r\n  if (req.method === \"POST\") {\r\n    return Response.json(\r\n      { message: \"Hello\" },\r\n      {\r\n        status: 429,\r\n      }\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return NextResponse.next();\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then any server action activated from the client will trigger it (because of the POST method). \r\n\r\nSay:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n\"use client\";\r\n\r\nimport { foo } from \"./_action\";\r\n\r\nexport default function Home() {\r\n  const sendForm = async () => {\r\n    const data = new FormData();\r\n\r\n    data.append(\"foo\", \"bar\");\r\n\r\n    const result = await foo(data);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return <button onClick={sendForm}>Send it</button>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere foo is:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\"use server\";\r\n\r\nexport async function foo(data: FormData) {\r\n  console.log(data.entries());\r\n  return { foo: \"bar\" };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe the server action needs to check for response.ok, and throw in that case? or if the content type is application/json, or if there's a `x-middleware-response` header, maybe take that, idk.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @icyJoseph in https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/62446#discussioncomment-8569735_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65144","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65144/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65144/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65144/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/65144","id":2267674778,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6HKfia","number":65144,"title":"<Link> doesn't navigate to the intercepted route in specific scenario ","user":{"login":"Neutrlno","id":87565633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTY1NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87565633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno","html_url":"https://github.com/Neutrlno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrlno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2471906168,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDcxOTA2MTY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fddf99","default":true,"description":"Issue was opened via the bug report template."},{"id":4932840687,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABJgUs7w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/linear:%20next","name":"linear: next","color":"A53EF5","default":false,"description":"Confirmed issue that is tracked by the Next.js team."},{"id":6834840742,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABl2Nkpg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/Parallel%20&%20Intercepting%20Routes","name":"Parallel & Intercepting Routes","color":"1C2649","default":false,"description":"Related to Parallel and/or Intercepting routes."}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2024-04-28T16:43:17Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T13:37:21Z","closed_at":"2024-06-04T13:37:21Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### Link to the code that reproduces this issue\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/great-lumiere-lgkkyj\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Run npm run dev to start the development server (works fine).\r\n4. Run npm run build to create a production build.\r\n5. Observe the \"Error: Element type is invalid\" error during the build process.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\n- Current behavior: When running npm run build, the project throws an \"Error: Element type is invalid\" error during the prerendering of the \"/\" page. The error suggests that an invalid element type is encountered, expecting a string or a class/function but getting an object.\r\n- Expected behavior: The project should build successfully without any errors, and the production build should be generated correctly.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"rhine\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"dev\": \"tinacms dev -c \\\"next dev\\\"\",\r\n    \"build\": \"tinacms build && next build\",\r\n    \"start\": \"tinacms build && next start\",\r\n    \"tinainit\": \"tinacms init backend\",\r\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@emotion/cache\": \"^11.11.0\",\r\n    \"@emotion/react\": \"^11.11.4\",\r\n    \"@emotion/styled\": \"^11.11.5\",\r\n    \"@mui/icons-material\": \"^5.15.15\",\r\n    \"@mui/material\": \"^5.15.15\",\r\n    \"next\": \"14.2.1\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^18\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^18\",\r\n    \"tinacms\": \"^1.6.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@tinacms/cli\": \"^1.5.43\",\r\n    \"eslint\": \"^8\",\r\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.1\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nOperating System: macOS\r\nBrowser: Not applicable (Node.js environment)\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

To Reproduce\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to do here is avoid showing a fallback UI when using `useTransition` on a page, but Next.js is still displaying it on the initial form submission even though I already wrapped the server action handler with a `startTransition`. 🤔\r\n\r\nI remember something along that router cache automatically does this when you call a `revalidatePath` or `revalidateTag` inside a server action, but may I know why it is not suspending if I miss just one fallback UI down the page?\r\n\r\nFor instance, on the codesandbox link I provided, currently, it doesn't have a fallback UI on the root page and only on the subpage hence it will not suspend, but following the instruction below somehow suspends the page. 🤷🏼 \r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the `/bug` page\r\n2. Submit the form\r\n3. Notice that the form will not suspend\r\n4. Rename the `app/_loading.tsx` to `app/loading.tsx`\r\n5. Submit the form again\r\n6. Notice that the form will suspend to the bug page loading boundary\r\n\r\nAnother weird thing is the page will also not be suspended if you do this\r\n\r\n1. Rename the `app/_loading.tsx` to `app/loading.tsx`\r\n2. Rename the `app/bug/loading.tsx` to `app/bug/_loading.tsx`\r\n3. Make sure to do a full-page reload\r\n4. Submit the form\r\n\r\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe **current behaviour** suspends the page if you have a `loading.tsx` but only once. Any succeeding form submission will not suspend the page.\r\n\r\nThe **expected behavior** should not suspend the page. Still, assuming that I just missed something on the docs like router cache or something and it should be suspended, it should be consistent behavior regardless of `loading.tsx` files appearance. If I have `loading.tsx` on the `/` but not on the `/bug`, then it should use that as a fallback UI. 🤷🏼 \r\n\r\n### Provide environment information\r\n\r\nThese specs came from codesandbox\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: linux\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun Aug  6 20:05:33 UTC 2023\r\n  Available memory (MB): 4102\r\n  Available CPU cores: 2\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.9.0\r\n  npm: 9.8.1\r\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\r\n  pnpm: 8.10.2\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.3.0-canary.28 // Latest available version is detected (14.3.0-canary.28).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.1.3\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which area(s) are affected?

Follow instruction to install [lowlight](https://github.com/wooorm/lowlight) \r\n2. Register a syntax highlight\r\n```javascript\r\nimport {createLowlight} from 'lowlight'\r\nimport xml from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/xml'\r\n\r\nconst lowlight = createLowlight()\r\n\r\nlowlight.register({xml})\r\n\r\n// Note: `html` is an alias for `xml`.\r\nconsole.log(lowlight.highlight('html', '<em>Emphasis</em>'))\r\n```\r\n3. Start dev server with turbo (`--turbo` defined in package.json) `npm run dev`\r\n4. Server crashes with error `Failed to compile`\r\n```\r\nModule not found: Can't resolve 'highlight.js/lib/languages/typescript'\r\n> 1 | import typescript from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/typescript'\r\n    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  2 | import {common, createLowlight} from 'lowlight'\r\n  3 |\r\n  4 | const lowlight = createLowlight()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect it compile without error, because it works correctly when dev server is run without turbopack (without `--turbo` flag). But it is currently failing with module not found. I noticed `--turbo` works if I include `highlight.js` as dependency.\r\n\r\n### Provide environment information\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: linux\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun Aug  6 20:05:33 UTC 2023\r\n  Available memory (MB): 4102\r\n  Available CPU cores: 2\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.9.0\r\n  npm: 9.8.1\r\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\r\n  pnpm: 8.10.2\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.3.0-canary.26 // There is a newer canary version (14.3.0-canary.28) available, please upgrade! \r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.1.3\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n ⚠ There is a newer canary version (14.3.0-canary.28) available, please upgrade! \r\n   Please try the latest canary version (`npm install next@canary`) to confirm the issue still exists before creating a new issue.\r\n   Read more - https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/opening-an-issue\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which area(s) are affected?

What\r\nWhen a page throws a `notFound()` error in `generateMetadata`, and the page contains parallel route(s), an unhandled runtime error would be thrown rather than displaying the not found page.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWe use the `<MetadataOutlet />` component to throw any errors caught during metadata resolution once the metadata is rendered by React so that it can be caught by an error boundary, so that it doesn't throw during metadata resolution. A promise is tracked & resolved with an error once the metadata tree is rendered. Once the promise resolves, the outlet component will throw. \r\n\r\nHowever, every `__PAGE__` segment that would be rendered as part of the page the user is on will render this `<MetadataOutlet />` component. We only need a single outlet per segment as only a single error needs to be thrown & caught. \r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis will only render a `MetadataOutlet` for the first parallel route that is encountered at each segment depth, as we only need a single handler to throw the error. \r\n\r\nFixes #65013\r\nCloses NEXT-3222\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65102/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65101","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65101/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65101/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65101/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65101","id":2266572661,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5t4qFi","number":65101,"title":"[trace] Reduce the size of .next/trace files","user":{"login":"mknichel","id":7355009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTUwMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7355009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel","html_url":"https://github.com/mknichel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mknichel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2024-04-26T22:19:52Z","updated_at":"2024-05-15T12:03:30Z","closed_at":"2024-04-30T16:39:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65101","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65101","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65101.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65101.patch","merged_at":"2024-04-30T16:39:50Z"},"body":"- Remove `next-swc-*` and `read-resource` spans since they are high volume and generally very fast\r\n- Added `NEXT_TRACE_SPAN_THRESHOLD_MS` env var to only record trace spans that take longer than a threshold.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65099","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65099/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65099/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65099/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/65099","id":2266494513,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6HF_Yx","number":65099,"title":"The example from the documentation doesn't work.

Set up an Intercepting Route in a Next.js application.\r\n2. Navigate to the page that triggers the Intercepting Route.\r\n3. From the Intercepting Route, use router.push('/') or a <Link href={'/'}> element to navigate back to the home page.\r\n4. Notice that the Intercepting Route does not close or unmount as expected.\r\n\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrent Behavior:\r\nWhen navigating away from an Intercepting Route using router.push('/') or <Link href={'/'}>, the Intercepting Route's component does not unmount or close, leaving the Intercepting Route's state or UI still active or visible in the background.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nUpon navigating away from an Intercepting Route using either router.push('/') or a <Link href={'/'}>, the Intercepting Route's component should unmount and close properly, similar to how it behaves when using router.back(). This ensures a consistent and predictable navigation experience within Next.js applications.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: win32\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: Windows 11 Pro\r\n  Available memory (MB): 16320\r\n  Available CPU cores: 6\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.12.2\r\n  npm: N/A\r\n  Yarn: N/A\r\n  pnpm: N/A\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.3 // Latest available version is detected (14.2.3).\r\n  eslint-config-next: 14.1.3\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: standalone\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

For example, if I have a lot of dynamic pages, and I want to render a parallel route that renders as a breadcrumb to enumerate those dynamic params, intuitively I'd reach for something like `app/@slot/[...allTheThings]/page.tsx`. Currently however, `[...allTheThings]` would only match params to a corresponding `app/[allTheThings]/page.tsx`. This makes it difficult to build the breadcrumbs use-case unless you re-create every single dynamic page in the parallel route as well. \r\n\r\nThis adds handling to provide unmatched catch-all routes with all of the params that are known. For example, if I was on `/app/[artist]/[album]/[track]`, and I visited `/zack/greatest-hits/1`, the parallel `@slot` params would receive: `{ allTheThings: ['zack', 'greatest-hits', '1']

base: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/actions/runs/8927220553/job/24520090130?pr=65281\r\n\r\nThe biggest change to our implementation is implementing the fetch patch that was removed from React: [`b59541d` (#65058)](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65058/commits/b59541debe6dd0fdb1472a99bb3aff770a6c111d)\r\n\r\n`<Head>` currently duplicates tags on the first client-side navigation. Looking into this before I land this.\r\n\r\n## Notable changes\r\n\r\nBetter hydration diffs: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65276\r\n\r\n## React changes that affect our test suite\r\n\r\naa503da67032db58555ff20cf3fb9df1addded73\r\n`React.cache` no longer works in client components\r\n\r\nb6393d02ea5c57b04bbb0ceb52a6b09c36d97a26\r\n(Known bug) Effects are currently not double invoked in `StrictMode` during hydration. We already experienced this in PPR tests but not because of PPR but because these tests were using React's experimental build\r\n\r\nDue to React Float, the loose reconciler for `Head` children (default) can loose track of `<script>` and cause re-execution. We already warn on `Head > script`. This can also be fixed by enabling `experimental.strictNextHead`.\r\n\r\n## BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n3d3b012257d1fe07b4704c825165b180a5632b6a\r\n`next/legacy/image` now relies on React server-side rendering to add `<link rel=\"preload\" />` to the `body` instead of `head`. React will take the attributes of the first `<img />` whereas `next/legacy/image` took the attributes of the last `<img />` with the same key. For example, `<img crossOrigin=\"use-credentials\" href=\"foo.png\" /><img crossOrigin=\"\" href=\"foo.png\" />` used to result in the image being preloaded with cross-origin set to anonymous. Now it would use `use-credentials` since that was specified in the first image.\r\n\r\n533827f6c5c4a728ae425d39327ba47bec1ce879\r\nWhen AMP is used, custom scripts (e.g. `<script />`) now fail AMP validation i.e. fail the build. They used to be removed without any validation error. \r\n\r\nPages router requires React version `19.0.0-beta-4508873393-20240430`. Once React 19.0.0 is out, we'll relax the peer dependency to `^19.0.0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses
