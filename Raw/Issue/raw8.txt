`unstable_after`, which lets the user schedule work to be executed after the response is finished.\r\n\r\n### Implementation notes\r\n\r\n- `unstable_after()` is a dynamic function (bypassable only with `export dynamic = \"force-static\"`)\r\n- Usable in: server components (including `generateMetadata`), actions, route handlers, middleware\r\n- It is meant to run its callbacks even if a response didn't complete successfully (thrown error) or called `notFound()`/`redirect()`\r\n- Currently gated behind a `experimental.after` feature flag, because it touches many runtime bits (including a React monkeypatch...)\r\n- The state for `unstable_after()` in a given request lives in `requestAsyncStorage` (added via `RequestAsyncStorageWrapper`)\r\n\r\n- the implementation is based around two functions that we inject via `renderOpts`:\r\n  - `waitUntil(promise)` - keep a function invocation alive until a promise settles. it is provided as a platform primitive in serverless contexts, and a noop in `next start`\r\n    - for serverless (nodejs), Next.js will attempt to get `waitUntil` from `globalThis[Symbol.for('@next/request-context')].get().waitUntil`.

What?\r\n\r\nCorrects the Bun install command (again) on [this page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app#interactive) of the docs.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe Bun instructions were originally created in 7e165384857893a25eb59b800c5af585a7778c71 with a correct command to create a new Next.js project with Bun: `bunx create-next-app`.\r\n\r\nThen, it was changed to `bunx create next-app` in 2ab4a443a20d3f8b977c18b94c93f23d4cecb413, which isn't correct because `bunx` acts like `npx` and tries to run a nonexistent package called `create`, specifying `next-app` as its argument.\r\n\r\nThis change was reverted in a42efae49db1d4302f4b0b5e07f9ee45742b0d95 two weeks ago, and a PR from today (#64972) reverts that correction.\r\n\r\nBoth `bunx create-next-app` and `bun create next-app` work on my machine as of Bun 1.0. `bunx create-next-app` is analogous to `npx create-next-app`, and `bun create next-app` is the same as `npm create next-app`.\r\n\r\n| Command | Correct? | Similar NPM command | Note |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| `bun create next-app` | :white_check_mark: | `npm create next-app` | My proposed change |\r\n| `bunx create-next-app` | :white_check_mark: | `npx create-next-app` | |\r\n| `bunx create next-app` | :x: | `npx create next-app` (incorrect) | Currently listed in the Next.js docs |\r\n| `bun create-next-app` | :x: | `npm create-next-app` (incorrect) | |\r\n\r\nI think this confusion is caused by having two valid ways to run `create-next-app` with two very similar syntaxes. **It could be beneficial to include a note explaining the two correct syntaxes** to avoid future confusion, but for now, I have just changed `bunx` -> `bun` to keep the command similar to `yarn` and `pnpm`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65015","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65015/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65015/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65015/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/65015","id":2262439572,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6G2haU","number":65015,"title":"Docs:

In other words, on the first request the cookie would be sent but wouldn't be available in the `cookies()` context. And then the following request would properly have the cookie values.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis uses a proxy on the `ResponseCookies` used in middleware to add a middleware override header with the cookie value. When we instantiate the cached cookies, we merge in whatever headers would have been set by middleware, so that they're available in the same render that invoked middleware. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThis changeset adds a test to confirm cookies set/deleted in middleware are available in a single pass. Verified with a deployment [here](https://vtest314-e2e-tests-ldx7olfl1-ztanner.vercel.app/rsc-cookies).\r\n\r\nFixes #49442\r\nCloses NEXT-1126\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65008/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65007","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65007/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65007/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65007/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65007","id":2262256503,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5tp4Mx","number":65007,"title":"test(fixture): prevent unexpected errored exit with leaking error","user":{"login":"kwonoj","id":1210596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTA1OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1210596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj","html_url":"https://github.com/kwonoj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwonoj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":4863306216,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABIeAp6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Turbopack%20team","name":"created-by: Turbopack team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the turbopack team"},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6835761499,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABl3FxWw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2024-04-24T21:58:43Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T12:02:19Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T02:27:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65007","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65007","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65007.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65007.patch","merged_at":"2024-04-25T02:27:32Z"},"body":"### What\r\n\r\nIn case of socket raises errors and there aren't any listener to handle it, node.js exits with non-0 exit code.

These were prone to bugs, and have already caused a few issues. This moves us over to the standard `parseArgs` ([docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/util.html#utilparseargsconfig)):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { parseArgs } from \"node:utils\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the argument parser dramatically, removing the need for any special patterns or accommodations. No need to maintain all these patterns when there's a lightweight built-in parser already available.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/53127\r\nFixes

encountered an issue where the `getBlogList()` API is being cached even after passing `next: { revalidate: 0 }` in the `OptionsType` object.\r\n\r\nTo provide context, within my codebase,  I am making two API calls: `getBlogList()` and `getSingleBlog()`. Despite explicitly setting `next: { revalidate: 0 }` in the `OptionsType` object for the `getBlogList()` API call, the response is still being cached.\r\n\r\nI have two pages. One page displays a list of all blogs, and the other page shows the details of a single blog. I'm using getBlogList() to fetch the list of blogs for the blog list page, and getSingleBlog() to fetch the details for the detailed blog page.\r\n\r\nwhenever I add a new blog to my application, I have to manually purge out the cache from Vercel in order for the new blog to be visible to our users in blog list page.\r\n\r\n### Provide environment information\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: win32\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: Windows 10 Pro\r\n  Available memory (MB): 16068\r\n  Available CPU cores: 8\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.12.0\r\n  npm: N/A\r\n  Yarn: N/A\r\n  pnpm: N/A\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.2 // Latest available version is detected (14.2.2).\r\n  eslint-config-next: 14.1.0\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.3.3\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which area(s) are affected?

What\r\nThe \"auto\" prefetching behavior differs between dev/prod, resulting in confusing DX when configuring `experimental.staleTimes = { static: 0, dynamic: 0 }`.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nPrefetching is intentionally disabled in dev, but we still will create an \"auto\" prefetch on navigation. When configuring `experimental.staleTimes` to have a `0` value in both static/dynamic cases (a pattern that isn't a good idea, but should still have consistent DX), it means that any auto prefetching that happens is effectively discarded immediately, as we also would also not be able to re-use the loading data.\r\n\r\nIn prod, we would have created a \"temporary\" prefetch for this case, which is effectively not a prefetch at all and gets the full RSC data. However in dev, we've special-cased these prefetches to be \"auto\", so the client won't ever receive fresh data after the first time the cache is seeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis removes the special-handling for dev to instead be similar to other prefetches that are created ad-hoc, and marks it as a \"temporary\" prefetch kind. This has the added benefit of not triggering 2 separate RSC calls in dev when only one is really needed. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nClient cache tests were previously disabled in dev because caching behavior does intentionally differ between dev/prod. But we can at the very least assert that the \"auto\" prefetching behavior is consistent between the two environments, so that's what has been added to the tests here.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a test for the `experimental.staleTimes = { static: 0, dynamic: 0 }` case. \r\n\r\nx-ref: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/54075#discussioncomment-9202650\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Create a hook `useFoo` that uses `useSyncExternalStore()` where the initial value of the server and the client rendering mismatch (ie. `getSnapshot` and `getServerSnapshot` disagree).\r\n    ```ts\r\n    import { useSyncExternalStore } from \"react\";\r\n\r\n    function getSnapshot() {\r\n      return 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function getServerSnapshot() {\r\n      return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function subscribe() {\r\n      return () => {};\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    export default function useExternalStoreWhereTheServerAndTheClientDisagreeOnFirstRender() {\r\n      return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot);\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n2. In a component `ComponentThatThrows`, call `useFoo` and throw when the return value is the value returned on the client (ie. the value returned by `getSnapshot()`).\r\n    ```ts\r\n    import { ReactNode } from \"react\";\r\n    import useExternalStoreWhereTheServerAndTheClientDisagreeOnFirstRender from \"./useExternalStoreWhereTheServerAndTheClientDisagreeOnFirstRender\";\r\n\r\n    export default function ComponentThatThrows(): ReactNode {\r\n      const num = useExternalStoreWhereTheServerAndTheClientDisagreeOnFirstRender();\r\n      if (num === 1) {\r\n        throw new Error(\"1 is the loneliest number\");\r\n      }\r\n      return <span>Nothing is everything</span>;\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n3. Wrap the whole thing in an `ErrorBoundary` and supply a fallback rendering.\r\n    ```jsx\r\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<>Something bad happened</>}>\r\n      <ComponentThatThrows />\r\n    </ErrorBoundary>\r\n    ```\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nI would expect the server rendering to appear, followed by the error boundary's fallback once the app has a chance to re-render on the client.\r\n\r\nI _do_ see that, but in addition to that the following warning appears on the console:\r\n\r\n> Warning: Cannot update a component (`HotReload`) while rendering a different component (`ComponentThatThrows`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `ComponentThatThrows`, follow the stack trace as described in https://reactjs.org/link/setstate-in-render\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n      Platform: linux\r\n      Arch: x64\r\n      Version: Ubuntu 20.04.0 LTS Tue Apr 23 2024 11:17:57 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)\r\n    Binaries:\r\n      Node: 18.18.0\r\n      npm: 10.2.3\r\n      Yarn: 1.22.19\r\n      pnpm: 8.15.3\r\n    Relevant Packages:\r\n      next: 13.5.1\r\n      eslint-config-next: 13.5.1\r\n      react: 18.2.0\r\n      react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n      typescript: 5.2.2\r\n    Next.js Config:\r\n      output: N/A\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

Only thing that could be better and is probably worth doing is adopting this change for the time it saves for unzipping, that's almost 4 seconds per test still.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Link to the code that reproduces this issue\n\nhttps://github.com/mmmulani/relay-multi/tree/main\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nNote: The linked github repo has a workaround in place.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about using Relay's multi-project configuration to have graphQL queries in different \"projects\" where one project can reference another. The most common example of this is something like a \"web\" folder that uses graphQL fragments in a \"shared\" folder.\r\n\r\nThis is \r\n\r\n1. Create a NextJS project in web-app.\r\n2. Add a multi-project Relay config to your web-app package.json, e.g.\r\n```\r\n  \"relay\": {\r\n    \"root\": \"..\",\r\n    \"sources\": {\r\n      \"shared\": \"shared\",\r\n      \"web-app\": \"web-app\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"projects\": {\r\n      \"shared\": {\r\n        \"language\": \"typescript\",\r\n        \"output\": \"shared/__generated__\",\r\n        \"schema\": \"shared/schema.graphql\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"web-app\": {\r\n        \"base\": \"shared\",\r\n        \"language\": \"typescript\",\r\n        \"output\": \"web-app/__generated__\",\r\n        \"schema\": \"shared/schema.graphql\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  ```\r\n 3. Create a component in `shared/` that uses graphQL, e.g. TestComponent.tsx with:\r\n```\r\nconst countryFragment = graphql`\r\n  fragment TestComponent_country on Country {\r\n    name\r\n    phone\r\n    currency\r\n    emoji\r\n  }\r\n`\r\n```\r\n 3. Try importing `shared/TestComponent` inside `web-app/`\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrent behaviour: the import fails as the Relay SWC plugin expects the Relay generated graphQL file to live in `web-app/__generated__` rather than `shared/__generated__`\r\n\r\n`Module not found: Can't resolve '/relay-multi/web-app/./__generated__/TestComponent_country.graphql.ts'`\r\n\r\nYou would expect there to be some way to specify the multi project config inside the `next.config.js` file so that the plugin knows to look in `shared/__generated__` rather than `web-app/__generated__`.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nYou can workaround this by modifying module resolution in next.config.js with:\r\n```js\r\nconst path = require(\"path\");\r\nconst webpack = require(\"webpack\");\r\n\r\nfunction graphQLRewrite() {\r\n  // This plugin works around an issue with Next.js's Relay support.\r\n  // Next.js's Relay plugin will convert the code like:\r\n  //   const userFragment = graphql`...`\r\n  // into:\r\n  //   const userFragment = import('<artifactDirectory>/UserFragment.graphql.ts')\r\n  // which works for Next.js projects with a single Relay folder. However, in our setup we have Relay files in\r\n  // @cv/shared-web, with generated artifacts in that folder as well.\r\n  // This plugin will rewrite the import statements for those graphql usages to match the correct artifactDirectory.\r\n  return new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(/\\.graphql\\.ts$/, (resource) => {\r\n    const repoRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '..'); // relay-multi/\r\n    const sourceFile = resource.contextInfo.issuer; // relay-multi/shared/TestComponent.tsx\r\n\r\n    const fileProjectDir = sourceFile.slice(repoRoot.length).split('/')[1]; // shared\r\n    const currentRequest = path.resolve(resource.request); // relay-multi/<some dir>/__generated__/TestComponent_country.graphql.ts\r\n    const fileName = path.basename(currentRequest); // TestComponent_country.graphql.ts\r\n\r\n    const correctGraphQLPath = path.resolve(repoRoot, fileProjectDir, '__generated__', fileName);\r\n    resource.request = correctGraphQLPath;\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst nextConfig = {\r\n  compiler: {\r\n    relay: {\r\n      src: './',\r\n      artifactDirectory: './__generated__',\r\n      language: 'typescript',\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  webpack: (config) => {\r\n    config.plugins.push(graphQLRewrite());\r\n    return config;\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: arm64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 23.0.0: Fri Sep 15 14:41:34 PDT 2023; root:xnu-10002.1.13~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T8103\r\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\r\n  Available CPU cores: 8\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 21.6.2\r\n  npm: 10.2.4\r\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\r\n  pnpm: N/A\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.2 // Latest available version is detected (14.2.2).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

New configuration updates include enabling `dedupe-injected-deps` and changing the lockfile to version 9, with better readability and resistance to Git conflicts.\r\n\r\n- [**v9.0.1**](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.0.1): Resolved issues with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, allowing it to work with lockfiles generated by PNPM v8 if no updates are required.\r\n\r\n- [**v9.0.2**](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.0.2): Addressed a bug where optional dependencies were not linked into dependent's `node_modules`. Fixed some other minor bugs.\r\n\r\n- [**v9.0.3**](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.0.3): Implemented changes to address the `script-shell` option erroring on Windows with `.bat` or `.cmd` files. Also fixed issues with `package-manager-strict` checks and added more completion command support.\r\n\r\n- [**v9.0.4**](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.0.4): Fixed aliased dependencies resolution on repeated installs with existing lockfiles and addressed issues with `engines.pnpm` field in package.json being ignored\r\n\r\n- [v9.0.5](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v9.0.5)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64854/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64853","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64853/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64853/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/64853/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/64853","id":2255507265,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6GcE9B","number":64853,"title":"eslint-config-next to have eslint ^9.x.x+ as peerDependencies","user":{"login":"alvinsjoy","id":89687635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njg3NjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89687635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy","html_url":"https://github.com/alvinsjoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvinsjoy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2108224491,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTA4MjI0NDkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/create-next-app","name":"create-next-app","color":"9effbb","default":false,"description":"Related to our CLI tool for quickly starting a new Next.js application."},{"id":2471906168,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDcxOTA2MTY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fddf99","default":true,"description":"Issue was opened via the bug report template."},{"id":3499543244,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis7QlsrM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/Linting","name":"Linting","color":"0EC69C","default":false,"description":"Related to `next lint` or ESLint with Next.js."},{"id":4932840687,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABJgUs7w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/linear:%20next","name":"linear: next","color":"A53EF5","default":false,"description":"Confirmed issue that is tracked by the Next.js team."},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2024-04-22T03:38:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-01T12:01:44Z","closed_at":"2024-05-18T04:19:27Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":"resolved","body":"### Link to the code that reproduces this issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/alvinsjoy/PortfolioWebsite/tree/renovate/major-eslint-monorepo\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nin package.json:\r\n```json\r\n\"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"eslint\": \"^9.0.0\",\r\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"14.2.2\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour:\r\n```\r\nnpm WARN ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency\r\nnpm WARN While resolving: @typescript-eslint/parser@6.21.0\r\nnpm WARN Found: eslint@9.1.0\r\nnpm WARN node_modules/eslint\r\nnpm WARN   dev eslint@\"^9.0.0\" from the root project\r\nnpm WARN   2 more (@eslint-community/eslint-utils, eslint-import-resolver-typescript)\r\nnpm WARN \r\nnpm WARN Could not resolve dependency:\r\nnpm WARN peer eslint@\"^7.0.0 || ^8.0.0\" from @typescript-eslint/parser@6.21.0\r\nnpm WARN node_modules/@typescript-eslint/parser\r\nnpm WARN   @typescript-eslint/parser@\"^5.4.2 || ^6.0.0 || 7.0.0 -
