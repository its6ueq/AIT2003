BREAKING CHANGE\r\n\r\nThis changes the behavior of the default image `loader` so that [`Content-Disposition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition#as_a_response_header_for_the_main_body) header is now `attachment` for added protection since the API can serve arbitrary remote images.\r\n\r\nThe new default value, `attachment`, forces the browser to download the image when visiting directly. This is particularly important when `dangerouslyAllowSVG` is true. Most users will not notice the change since visiting pages won't behave any differently, only visiting images directly.\r\n\r\nUsers can switch back to the old behavior by configuring `inline` in next.config.js\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  images: {\r\n    contentDispositionType: 'inline',\r\n  },\r\n}","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65627","id":2290348988,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5vIb36","number":65627,"title":"Implement insertion stream utilities for Node.js Streams","user":{"login":"Ethan-Arrowood","id":16144158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ0MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16144158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood","html_url":"https://github.com/Ethan-Arrowood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethan-Arrowood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-05-10T20:09:49Z","updated_at":"2024-05-28T00:07:12Z","closed_at":"2024-05-13T16:05:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":true,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65627","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65627","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65627.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65627.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"This pull request includes changes to stream-utils.node.ts to incorporate two new functions createInsertedHTMLStream and createHeadInsertionTransformStream.

Node.js: ⚠️ Not enabled in the test because Node.js does not support it currently in 18.x which we run tests against.\r\n\t\t- Turbopack: Works\r\n\t\t- Webpack: Fails in Webpack currently on `acorn`

Link to the code that reproduces this issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bosconian-dynamics/cna-repro-yarn-pnp-gh\r\n\r\n**Note:** the issue is itself the inability to push repos which create-next-app produces to GitHub, and as such it prevents me from creating a minimal reproduction repository. The repo above is a dummy to satisfy the issue template requirements.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn a WSL2 Ubuntu x64 environment (or likely other linux/unix environments):\r\n1. `yarn create next-app foobar`\r\n2. `cd foobar`\r\n3. `git remote add origin https://github.com/xxx/foobar`\r\n4. `git push origin main`\r\n\r\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\r\n\r\n### Observation\r\n\r\nIn linux/unix environments (or at the very least in WSL2 Ubuntu 20 x64, and [evidently Darwin x64](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/48956)), Yarn PnP in combination with create-next-app's templates' `.gitignore` files result in create-next-app creating project repositories with an initial commit which cannot be pushed to free GitHub repositories due to the 100M file size limitation. The large file in question appears to be the Next compiler which resides at the following location in my Next repositories:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.yarn/unplugged/@next-swc-linux-x64-gnu-npm-14.2.3-635f7187f5/node_modules/@next/swc-linux-x64-gnu/next-swc.linux-x64-gnu.node\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my environment, the `git push` operation produces the following output:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git push origin main\r\nEnumerating objects: 798, done.\r\nCounting objects: 100% (798/798), done.\r\nDelta compression using up to 12 threads\r\nCompressing objects: 100% (782/782), done.\r\nWriting objects: 100% (798/798), 203.24 MiB | 4.00 MiB/s, done.\r\nTotal 798 (delta 13), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\r\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (13/13), done.\r\nremote: error: Trace: 196be7017bc6c58f3bfa0e53058cf07f500569efac1b596ff8524f176dd0a7b7\r\nremote: error: See https://gh.io/lfs for more information.\r\nremote: error: File .yarn/unplugged/@next-swc-linux-x64-gnu-npm-14.1.0-5a9ae6f5df/node_modules/@next/swc-linux-x64-gnu/next-swc.linux-x64-gnu.node is 114.62 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB\r\nremote: error: GH001: Large files detected.

[remote rejected] main -> main (pre-receive hook declined)\r\nerror: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/xxx/foobar.git'\r\n```\r\n\r\nResolving the issue necessitates a fair bit of research on the end-user's part, and ultimately the modification of the default `.gitignore` file provided by the templates as well as squashing or rewriting the repo's history to exclude the problematic files. Alternately - if users instead follow the advice suggested by the `git` error - they may end up down a different rabbit hole, setting up Git LFS (and likely engaging GitHub's LFS services which may incur costs in short order) just to handle the SWC binary.\r\n\r\nThe issue is [compounded in downstream tools such as Cloudflare's `create-cloudflare`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/5790), which themselves may create additional commits on top of the one which create-next-app makes, further cementing the problematic file's inclusion in the fresh project repository's history.\r\n\r\n### Expectation\r\n\r\nProject repositories created via create-next-app should be able to be pushed to a free GitHub repository immediately, without requiring the end-user to modify default files and squashing/rewriting repository history or set up Git LFS.\r\n\r\n### Provide environment information\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: linux\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: #1 SMP Wed Mar 2 00:30:59 UTC 2022\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.11.1\r\n  npm: 10.2.4\r\n  Yarn: 4.2.2\r\n  pnpm: N/A\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.1.0\r\n  eslint-config-next: 14.1.0\r\n  react: 18.3.1\r\n  react-dom: 18.3.1\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which area(s) are affected?

When I console.log my slide images to ensure they are loaded correctly, I can see that they are so the issue isn't there. If I put the same image for all the slides, only the first one loads still. So the issue isn't from the images I am trying to use in my swiper. I also tried several other packages offering carousels/swipers, and even written by myself without a package, all the codes I have tried led to the same issue, one slide only. I figured at some point that it looks like the 3 images/ slides are actually appearing yet the last two for just a second, then they vanish, leaving only the first one on screen.

When I console.log my slide images to ensure they are loaded correctly, I can see that they are so the issue isn't there. If I put the same image for all the slides, only the first one loads still. So the issue isn't from the images I am trying to use in my swiper.  I also tried several other packages offering carousels/swipers, and even written by myself without a package, all the codes I have tried led to the same issue, one slide only. I figured at some point that it looks like the 3 images/ slides are actually appearing yet the last two for just a second, then they vanish, leaving only the first one on screen. It really seems to be the case with every swipers. I also tried \"use client\", without success...\r\n\r\nYou can check the issue on this page, it's the carousel swiper on this same page: https://wave-riders-ecommerce.vercel.app/\r\n\r\nPlease note that the first slide is also controllable with the mouse while the other 2 aren't.

What is the update you wish to see?\n\nIn the Pages Router docs, under Building Your Application > Authentication there is an Authorization section that recommends creating a Data Access Layer, using Data Transfer Objects, and using Middleware. Each of these have a link associated with them. The Middleware link is fine, but each of the other links have issues:\r\n\r\n1. The Data Access Layer link should point to the heading on the page (https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication#creating-a-data-access-layer-dal-1), but it instead points to a broken link (https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication#creating-a-data-access-layer-dal). Simply updating the url would fix this issue.\r\n2. The Data Transfer Object link should point to a section on using Data Transfer Objects, but this section only exists on the **_app router_** documentation (https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication#using-data-transfer-objects-dto), not on the **_pages router_** documentation. This section would need to be added to the pages router documentation.\n\n### Is there any context that might help us understand?\n\nThe \"Using Data Transfer Objects (DTO)\" section in the app router documentation would not be able to be shared by both docs, as the code example in the app router builds off of code which doesn't match the pages router example. An example specific to the pages router would need to be written and included in the <Pages Only> content.\n\n### Does the docs page already exist? Please link to it.\n\nhttps://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication#authorization","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65530/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65529","id":2286324493,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5u61Fc","number":65529,"title":"chore:

Hence we don't need to add `.xml` in the url.\r\n\r\nBefore this change it could also result into the different url between dev and prod:\r\ndev: `/sitemap.xml/[id]`\r\nprod: `/sitemap/[id].xml` \r\n\r\nNow it's going to be aligned as `/sitemap/[id]`.
