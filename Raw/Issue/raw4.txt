Link to the code that reproduces this issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/renanleonel/next-auth-v5-middleware\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

When set to `Yes`, the `package.json` script for `dev` is modified from `next dev` to `next dev --turbo`.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Updated the interactive CLI prompt to include the Turbopack option.\r\n2. Modified the `createApp` function to adjust the `dev` script in `package.json` based on the user's selection.\r\n3. Updated the documentation to describe the new option and its use.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nUpdates were made to [create-next-app documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app) to include the new Turbopack option.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nThis change provides developers an opportunity to opt-in to using Turbopack during development, offering potentially faster builds and improves developer experience. Given that Turbopack is currently in RC, the default is set to `No` to ensure stability for most users.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTested the implementation by running `create-next-app` and selecting different combinations of templates to ensure that the dev script updates appropriately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65927","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65927/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65927/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65927/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65927","id":2304136432,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5v3Wnc","number":65927,"title":"feat(create-next-app):

user deploying Next.js behind any CDN other Vercel expects SWR to work correctly, but it does not because there is no default expiry value.\r\n\r\nThis change will make the default work for all

The issue I linked above suggests to use `serverComponentsExternalPackages`. However, this turns on App Router features that has consequences that cause errors. \r\n\r\nAccording to the Next docs, there's an option [serverExternalPackages](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/serverExternalPackages). However, it seems this option is no longer in the config? There's no intellisense for it and manually putting it in the config causes an error.\r\n\r\nI've done this setup before in an earlier version of Next and downgrading isn't a possibility for me right now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65861","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65861/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65861/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65861/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65861","id":2300994153,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5vstnU","number":65861,"title":"refactor:

Why?\r\n\r\nThe current `lint-staged` hook uses [function signature](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged?tab=readme-ov-file#function-signature) to target the **staged files** and has extra steps for handling those files that seem to have been passed on from a [5-year-old legacy code](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/9245).\r\n\r\nThe entire process is unnecessary today since `lint-staged` only runs on the staged files.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nThis PR removed unnecessary logic, removed some no-effect flags, and [removed `git

What?\r\n\r\nUpgrades sharp to the latest version and relies on more of its default settings (if the default settings are unsuitable, we should consider improving these for all users in sharp itself).\r\n\r\n- The `sequentialRead` setting is now managed for you based on each input image and the operations to be applied to it.\r\n\r\n- The concurrency detection is more accurate than `os.cpus()` as it now inspects things like CPU set/affinity as well as the memory allocator.\r\n\r\n- The (mostly archaic) concept of chroma subsampling is not required for AVIF output. Using full chroma should improve the quality of red/orange edges, as well as slightly reducing file size as it allows greater use of AV1 chroma-from-luma prediction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR also enables the use of mozjpeg features such as trellis quantisation to produce smaller file sizes. The use of `mozjpeg: true` infers `progressive: true`. This aligns JPEG output behaviour with the previously-used squoosh, which always used mozjpeg.\r\n\r\n/cc @styfle ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65845","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65845/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65845/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65845/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65845","id":2299899684,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5vo7m3","number":65845,"title":"Upgrade react@beta","user":{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":549032284,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDkwMzIyODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/examples","name":"examples","color":"ecffaf","default":false,"description":"Issue/PR related to examples"},{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2108224491,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTA4MjI0NDkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/create-next-app","name":"create-next-app","color":"9effbb","default":false,"description":"Related to our CLI tool for quickly starting a new Next.js application."},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6835761499,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABl3FxWw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2024-05-16T09:48:06Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T00:04:16Z","closed_at":"2024-05-16T19:59:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65845","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65845","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65845.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65845.patch","merged_at":"2024-05-16T19:59:47Z"},"body":"Ensures `useMemoCache` is available for the React Compiler.\r\n\r\nRequired for #65804 without having to manually enable experimental React through e.g. taint: true.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

This is most notable in the case of the Next SWC binary, which may exceed 100M in some environments (empirically, 64-bit Darwin and WSL2 Ubuntu, and very probably other unix/linux environments), and prevent users from pushing their new projects to free GitHub repositories without rewriting the commit history to exclude the extraneous files, or unnecessarily setting up Git LFS to include them.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nI have errored on the side of exclusion to enable users to push their CNA projects to GitHub as-is and for parity with other package managers, while still providing the opportunity to opt in to additional functionality provided by modern Yarn.\r\n\r\nThese changes follow the recommendations for non-[Zero-Install](https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching#zero-installs) configurations, as Zero-Install functionality is an extension on top of the base package manager experience, and may necessitate additional configuration and present additional complications for unsuspecting users, so I think it's best left up to the user to opt-in. On account of the majority of publicly available Next.js-based projects comprising general consumer-facing websites, it is my belief that the majority of Next projects would not benefit from Yarn's Zero-Install functionality, and that explicitly facilitating it by default would break status quo with all other non-Yarn CNA projects.\r\n\r\nContrary to the example `.gitignore`s provided by Yarn, I've excluded the `.yarn/sdks` directory as it contains IDE-specific tooling;  I feel it would be presumptuous for an environmentally-agnostic tool to target and provide package-manager-specific tooling for specific editors. This too should be left to the user to opt-in to and provide for their project if they deem necessary.\r\n\r\nI have retained the current `.gitignore`'s exclusion of the `/.pnp` directory for backwards compatibility with older versions of Yarn (the files therein have since been reallocated to the `.yarn` directory addressed by these changes, but I am not clear on when that delineation occurred or the prevalence of Yarn installations which depend on the former convention). Maintaining the exclusion here, in the worst case, implies additional downloads (on an order of magnitude merely similar to using npm from the outset) rather than failure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65823/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65822","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65822/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65822/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65822/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65822","id":2298969182,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5vlv6r","number":65822,"title":"test:

It's not a proper state for close more for erroring.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for adding the queuing for the task of dom content loaded callback, after investigation, I found that if the DOMLoaded execute earlier the readable stream controller cuold close earlier on client, which lead to the \"Connection Closed.\" error.

Why is `next build` not reproducible within the exact same environment with the exact same code after 1 month passed?\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nI can't run `next info` because it is running inside a docker container. The docker image itself is deployed on a CentOS 7.\r\n\r\nWe use `node:20-slim` as base image with `pnpm` installed inside\r\n\r\nDockerfile is: https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/cohort-explorer/blob/main/frontend/Dockerfile\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

Your contribution is much appreciated.\r\nTo make sure your PR is handled as smoothly as possible we request that you follow the checklist sections below.\r\nChoose the right checklist for the change(s) that you're making:\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-\r\nFixes #\r\n\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces a **breaking change** that returns a 400 error if the Image Optimization API is given a protocol-relative URL.\r\n\r\nThe Image Optimization API currently checks whether the given image URL is relative by checking `url.startsWith('/')`. This means that protocol-relative URLs, such as `//example.com`, pass the check and are treated as relative. They in turn skip any kind of validation provided when matching against `remotePatterns` and are passed back to the optimation logic as a relative URL.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the stack stops there, but in our case at GitBook it led to a nasty attack where non-GitBook content could be served over this URL: https://docs.gitbook.com/_next/image?url=//example.com&w=1200&q=100 - even though we have configured `remotePatterns` to protect against it.\r\n\r\nI originally went into the problem wanting to handle the URL properly (treating it as an absolute URL and potentially using the protocol of the Optimization API itself as the relative protocol), but after seeing the code in \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/client/legacy/image.tsx#L135\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/shared/lib/image-loader.ts#L26\r\n\r\nit feels that protocol-relative URLs are just not really supported anywhere. My understanding is that very few uses of `next/image` will be allowed to use protocol-relative URLs, so the impact of this breaking change should be quite low? If others disagree I am happy to modify and to use the protocol of the request as a stand-in for the relative protocol.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65751","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65751/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65751/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65751/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65751","id":2296008439,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5vbj9v","number":65751,"title":"Remove process auto polyfill in edge runtime","user":{"login":"huozhi","id":4800338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDAzMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4800338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi","html_url":"https://github.com/huozhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huozhi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6835761499,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABl3FxWw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2024-05-14T17:29:50Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T12:01:51Z","closed_at":"2024-05-15T10:19:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65751","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65751","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65751.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65751.patch","merged_at":"2024-05-15T10:19:47Z"},"body":"### What\r\n\r\nDisable auto polyfill for process in edge runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nReact uses process.emit behind a typeof guard now.
