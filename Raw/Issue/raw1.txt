This approach fail the static optimization and make mapping url pretty difficult as parsing the file to check the module exports has to be done before it.\r\n\r\n#### Benifits\r\n\r\nFor image routes urls, this approach could help on static generation such as single `/opengraph-image` route can be treated as static, and then it can get static optimized if possible.\r\n\r\n**Before**: `/opengraph-image/[[...id]]` cannot be optimized\r\n**After**: single route `/opengraph-image` and multi-route `/opengraph-image/[id]` are both possible to be statically optimized\r\n\r\nFor sitemap, since we removed appending `.xml` for dynamic routes, it’s hard for users to have `/sitemap.xml` url with dynamic route convention `sitemap.js` . But users desire smooth migration and flexibility. So it would be nice to have a new convention `sitemap.xml.[ext]` that helps user have route with extension.\r\n\r\n**Before**: In v15 rc we removed the `.xml` appending that `sitemap.js` will generate url `/sitemap` makes users hard to migrate, as users need to re-submit the new sitemap url.\r\n**After**: Now we'll consistently generate the `.xml`. Single route will become `/sitemap.xml`, and multi route will become `/sitemap/[id].xml`. It's still better than v15 as the urls generation is consistent, no difference between dev and prod.\r\n\r\nHere's the url generation comparsion\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nAll the routes are dynamic which cannot be optimized, we only had a hacky optimization for prodution build multi-routes sitemap routes\r\n\r\n|  | only default export | `export generateImageMetadata()` | `export  generateSitemaps()` |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\r\n| opengraph-image.js | /opengraph-image/[[...id]] | /opengraph-image[[...id]]/ | /opengraph-image/[[...id]] |\r\n| sitemap.js | /sitemap/[[...id]] | /sitemap/[[...id]] | dev: `/sitemap/[[...id]]` prod: `/sitemap/[id]`  |\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nMost of the single route will are to get statically optimized now, and the multi-routes sitemap are able to get SSG now\r\n\r\n|  | only default export | `export generateImageMetadata()` | `export generateSitemaps()` |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\r\n| opengraph-image.js | /opengraph-image | /opengraph-image/[id] | - |\r\n| sitemap.js | /sitemap.xml | - | /sitemap/[id].xml |\r\n\r\nNext.js will have less overhead of mapping urls, we can easily multiply the urls generation simply based on file conventions.\r\n\r\nx-ref: feedback from #65507 \r\nCloses

(Select all that apply)\n\nNavigation\n\n### Which stage(s) are affected? (Select all that apply)\n\nOther (Deployed)\n\n### Additional context\n\n- I have deployed the Next App using App Service of Azure. \r\n- I have configured a middleware as well into the App. In order to get the current URL, i'm setting `x-pathname` and accessing it in the `Layout.tsx`.  \r\n\r\n **Example**\r\n\r\n- When a User A is logged in, I copied a link [](https://capable-dev.almma.ai/persona/share/RVu0CYT4qL5piEJvpyvckz4xi3rKDuSjVXnh) from the App into the Clipboard. \r\n- Then I pasted the same copied link into the Slack. After which User A logs out. \r\n- User B simply logs into their account and suddenly they gets redirected to the User A Pasted Link on the Slack out of nowhere!\r\n- Take a note that the User B didn't had the link and nor User B intentionally Pasted the URL in the Browser. \r\n\r\n**Observations** \r\n\r\n- If the Link is not pasted into the Slack, then everything works smoothly and no unexpected redirection appears. \r\n- Whenever the any same Next Project link is pasted into the Slack's Chat,and any current logged in user refreshes the Page, they will get redirected to the pasted link on the Slack. \r\n- This scenario doesn't get replicated in the Local Dev Environment. It only gets replicated in the Staging and Prod Environments.

You can also see the app running here: https://nextndc.vercel.app/slides/1, so it works fine when built but dev mode doesn't work.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: arm64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 23.4.0: Fri Mar 15 00:12:49 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.101.17~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\r\n  Available memory (MB): 65536\r\n  Available CPU cores: 12\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 18.17.0\r\n  npm: 9.6.7\r\n  Yarn: 1.22.21\r\n  pnpm: 9.1.0\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 15.0.0-rc.0 // Latest available version is detected (15.0.0-rc.0).\r\n  eslint-config-next: 14.2.3\r\n  react: 19.0.0-rc.0\r\n  react-dom: 19.0.0-rc.0\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

from https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66461#discussion_r1624096023\r\n\r\nWhen using app dir and pages dir together, the [navigation compatibility types](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/48e9cd9b60668c556f4304f8c082d7840db8f53e/packages/next/navigation-types/compat/navigation.d.ts) as introduced in #45919 are added to `next-env.d.ts` with the following triple-slash directive:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/// <reference types=\"next/navigation-types/compat/navigation\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis augments the types from `next/navigation` ([source](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/48e9cd9b60668c556f4304f8c082d7840db8f53e/packages/next/src/client/components/navigation.ts)). But TypeScript fails to do the augmentation and reports the following errors (excerpt):\r\n\r\n```\r\nType error: Overload signatures must all be exported or non-exported.\r\n\r\n> 11 |   export function useSearchParams(): ReadonlyURLSearchParams | null\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this error is suppressed in most Next.js projects, because [`skipLibCheck` is set to `true`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/48e9cd9b60668c556f4304f8c082d7840db8f53e/packages/next/src/lib/typescript/writeConfigurationDefaults.ts#L35) per default. It only arises if users explicitly set it to `false`, e.g. if they don't mind the longer compilation times and want to avoid that third-party dependencies are accidentally untyped because of compile errors. [^1]\r\n\r\nThe error is caused by using a separate export declaration for those functions. If we use export modifiers on the function declarations the augmentation can be fixed.\r\n\r\nI've verified that the e2e test `test/e2e/app-dir/use-params` fails on the first commit of this PR (setting `skipLibCheck` to `false`), and succeeds on the second commit.\r\n\r\n[^1]: I don't want to open a can of worms, but maybe we should consider not using `\"skipLibCheck\": true` as a default compiler setting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66489/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66488","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66488/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66488/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66488/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66488","id":2330671094,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5xRjNU","number":66488,"title":"chore(docs): Update Inlang Link on Internationalization Page","user":{"login":"LorisSigrist","id":43482866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDgyODY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43482866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist","html_url":"https://github.com/LorisSigrist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorisSigrist/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":3644980154,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis7ZQfu6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/Documentation","name":"Documentation","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Related to Next.js' official documentation."}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-06-03T09:43:51Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T18:43:31Z","closed_at":"2024-06-03T18:43:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/66488","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66488","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66488.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66488.patch","merged_at":"2024-06-03T18:43:31Z"},"body":"Hi 👋 Inlang dev here\r\n\r\nThis PR switches the Link to Inlang's i18n solution in the Internationalization docs to point directly to [Paraglide-Next](https://inlang.com/m/osslbuzt/paraglide-next-i18n) since that's the most relevant page for NextJS developers looking for an i18n library. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

PR fixes (and simplifies) identifier tracking in the Server Actions SWC transform. \r\n\r\nIn an inlined `\"use server\"` function, the transform tracks which variables are used inside the function body, but defined in an upper-level closure. These variables need to be automatically passed via `$$bound` and encrypted.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we are tracking these variables as \"Names\", which is a pair of identifier and property access list. For example if `foo.bar.baz` is used inside the function body, we track `(Ident(foo), [Ident(bar), Ident(baz)])` as an occurrence and only pass that `.bar.baz` sub-field across the RSC boundary. This saves the bytes being transfered over the network, comparing to passing the full `foo` value.\r\n\r\nHowever, that causes a couple of tricky problems in the past. For example, the transform becomes too complicated so it can handle duplicated fields:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function () {\r\n  \"use server\"\r\n  console.log(foo.bar, foo.bar.baz)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case we need to pass only `foo.bar` as the other one is a subset. And then, there're cases like dynamic field access like `foo[field]` where we need to opt-out.\r\n\r\nThe hard blocking issue that makes me removing this optimization is that we can't tell if a member expression is a field of a value, or a JS builtin method. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function () {\r\n  \"use server\"\r\n  foo.push('123')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case we can't pass `foo.push` over the boundary as it's likely an array. One workaround is to check if it's a function call. But an opposite case can be that `foo` is an object with a field `push` of another Server Action, which is totally valid. And also, the code might not be statically analyzable and we can't tell if it will be a function call or not.\r\n\r\nA better workaround can be keeping a full list of potential JS native method names for data types that are RSC compatible, and opt-out only one of them are seen. But that list is just too long (consider arrays, objects, sets, maps, ...).\r\n\r\nBecause of all the reasons and for simplicity and correctness, I think it's better to just send the full value along.\r\n\r\ncc @sebmarkbage ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66462","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66462/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66462/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66462/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/66462","id":2329356790,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6K1yn2","number":66462,"title":"The `maxDuration` setting in the api route config, as per the documentation, isn't being honored on dev or on Vercel.

While deploying, I have set the `maxDuration` to be 35s\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1223\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/assets/5714957/9ea3a0af-b2e2-49fc-88a4-caff605fa559\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n```js\r\n`next info`\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: x64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 21.5.0: Tue Apr 26 21:08:22 PDT 2022; root:xnu-8020.121.3~4/RELEASE_X86_64\r\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\r\n  Available CPU cores: 12\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 21.7.3\r\n  npm: 10.5.0\r\n  Yarn: N/A\r\n  pnpm: N/A\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.3 // Latest available version is detected (14.2.3).\r\n  eslint-config-next: 13.3.0\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.4.2\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @v-ahuja in https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/66269_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66461","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66461/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66461/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66461/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66461","id":2329340759,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5xNLgA","number":66461,"title":"Fix broken `BrowserInterface` type","user":{"login":"unstubbable","id":761683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable","html_url":"https://github.com/unstubbable","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unstubbable/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5552804017,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABSvkQsQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/CI%20approved","name":"CI approved","color":"75AC05","default":false,"description":"Approve running CI for fork"},{"id":6835761499,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABl3FxWw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-06-01T21:07:30Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T13:43:15Z","closed_at":"2024-06-03T12:56:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/66461","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66461","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66461.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66461.patch","merged_at":"2024-06-03T12:56:49Z"},"body":"All ~1400 assignment calls of `await next.browser()` and `await webdriver()` in the typescript test files currently have an inferred type of `any`. [^1] This impacts DX while writing e2e tests due to intellisense not working for any of the `BrowserInterface` methods, and it also masks other compiler errors in the `test` folder due to typescript apparently bailing out of a full compilation.\r\n\r\nI'm not happy about using so many `any`s here, but this is due to having this abstract `BrowserInterface` class that is not supposed to know about the actual testing framework's types. It's definitely better though than what we have right now. As a next step, either we define proper common types for those, or we merge the `BrowserInterface` and `Playwright` classes and just expose the Playwright types, since Selenium is not used anymore. We could also consider deprecating the custom chain methods altogether, and using Playwright's APIs directly.\r\n\r\n[^1]: Excluding four cases that were explicitly annotated with `BrowserInterface` as a workaround.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66457","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66457/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66457/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66457/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66457","id":2329278549,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5xM--C","number":66457,"title":"special case server-patch action in action queue","user":{"login":"ztanner","id":1939140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner","html_url":"https://github.com/ztanner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztanner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-06-01T18:28:11Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T20:54:23Z","closed_at":"2024-06-05T20:54:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":true,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/66457","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66457","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66457.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66457.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

the router encounters a `stale` cache entry, it clears the `rsc` data so that it can be fetched in render. All navigations (even just for hash fragments) flow through the navigation reducer, which has logic to discard any existing cache entries when the cache is stale.\r\n\r\nThis bug has become more obvious after removing the default 30s cache, which would previously have masked it.\r\n\r\nThis updates the existing handling that clears flight data to not do so if only the hash changes as there would be no server changes in this case. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://next-loading-revalidate-refresh-issue.vercel.app/\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run the application with `next dev`\r\n2. Click the button\r\n3. View useFormState state logged to console\r\n4. Observe reloading suspended component\r\n\r\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour:\r\n\r\nWhen both a loading.tsx is used *and* revalidatePath is called in a server action, the first time the server action runs the form state does not update with values returned from the server action, and a full page refresh happens causing suspended components on the page to reload.\r\n\r\nSubsequent interactions in the same user session work as expected, even between page navigations.
