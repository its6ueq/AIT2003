This is usually trees-shaken but in nextjs we must declare it to be optimized to be have this way. To provide a better experience to users I added all the packages in the ecosystem to the list that are possibly relevant.

What?\r\n\r\nImplements support for running the Turbopack trace server, which is the websocket server that powers https://turbo-trace-viewer.vercel.app/ when using `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACE_SERVER=1`.\r\n\r\nCurrently you have to manually run the server through the Turbo repository which in practice means that only people working on Turbopack are able to run it.\r\n\r\nWith the bindings implemented anyone should be able to run the trace server.\r\n\r\nNote that the traces that come out of Turbopack are very low level, they're meant for optimizing Turbopack like finding slowdowns / large memory usage / optimizing performance. \r\n\r\nHowever, it's useful for people that want to peek into why their application is slow to compile. I.e. we've used https://turbo-trace-viewer.vercel.app to investigate reports in #48748.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for `trace.log` by default, so if you add `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACE_SERVER=1` it will automatically select the `trace.log` for the current instance of Next.js. You can only have one trace server running at the same time.\r\n\r\n### `next internal` \r\n\r\nIn order to support running the trace server standalone, which is useful for investigating trace files other people have shared, I've added a new subcommand `internal` that is not covered by semver / use at your own risk. It's meant for internal tools that are useful to be bound to the version of Next.js, the turbo-trace-server is a great example of that as it has an internal binary format for storing data that needs to match the trace.log file.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take a look at `.next/trace` instead the new `next internal` subcommand can be used for that:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Replace [path] with a path to a file.\r\nnext internal turbo-trace-server [path]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnext internal turbo-trace-server ~/Downloads/trace\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently the trace server does not support loading multiple files, just hasn't been implemented yet. Once we can load two or more files we can load both `.next/trace` and `trace.log` when `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACE_SERVER=1` and support multiple paths passed to `next internal turbo-trace-server`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Turbopack upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\nPR includes a Turbopack upgrade:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8073 <!-- OJ Kwon - feat(webpack-loaders): support dummy span interface  -->\r\n* https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8083 <!-- OJ Kwon - fix(webpack): print resource, project path when relative calc fails  -->\r\n* https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8094 <!-- Tim Neutkens - Implement bindings for Turbopack trace server  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

revalidating a page that corresponds with a dynamic path and when using the “type” parameter, eg `revalidatePath(“/dynamic/1”, “page”)` corresponding with `/dynamic/[id]`, the wrong cache tags would be checked to determine if a revalidation occurred.\r\n\r\nThis is because the “derived” cache tags created for a `/dynamic/[id]/page` are: \r\n- /dynamic/[id]/layout\r\n- /dynamic/[id]/page\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a tag is added for the current canonical URL, so the final tag would be:\r\n- /dynamic/1\r\n\r\nThus a fetch on `/dynamic/1` would be tagged with the following:\r\n- /layout\r\n- /dynamic/layout\r\n- /dynamic/[id]/layout\r\n- /dynamic/[id]/page\r\n- /dynamic/1\r\n\r\nCalling `revalidatePath(“/dynamic/1”, “page”)` would signal to revalidate caches tagged `/dynamic/1/page` in the current logic. However, this tag doesn’t exist given the above, so it would be a no-op and wouldn't properly re-invoke the fetch. \r\n\r\nThis updates the docs to explicitly call out that if you are attempting to revalidate a path that corresponds with a dynamic page, that you should not provide a \"type\" argument. \r\n\r\nFixes #62071\r\nCloses NEXT-3302\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65364","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65364/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65364/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65364/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/65364","id":2279185049,"node_id":"I_kwDOBC3Cis6H2ZqZ","number":65364,"title":"Unable to build app by docker for --platform=linux/amd64 on MacOS M1","user":{"login":"anteqkois","id":73034007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDM0MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73034007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois","html_url":"https://github.com/anteqkois","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anteqkois/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2471906168,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDcxOTA2MTY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fddf99","default":true,"description":"Issue was opened via the bug report template."},{"id":3499651836,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis7QmHL8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/Output%20(export/standalone)","name":"Output (export/standalone)","color":"31A7C3","default":false,"description":"Related to the the output option in `next.config.js`."},{"id":5907879217,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABYCMVMQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/invalid%20link","name":"invalid link","color":"444444","default":false,"description":"The issue was auto-closed due to a missing/invalid reproduction link.

But we currently only pass the custom not-found component to the `<NotFoundBoundary />` for the `children` slot. This means that if a parallel route throws a `notFound()` in `generateMetadata`, it'd be caught by the root not found, which would be unexpected.\r\n\r\nThis mirrors the logic for determining whether or not a `notFound` boundary should be provided. A side effect of this is that if you throw a `notFound()` in `generateMetadata` for a segment that _only_ has parallel routes, and no `children` slot, it won't be caught by the boundary. But fixing this will require a larger refactor. \r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

Not easy to remove unless we have separate implementation of `next/image` for pages and app router\r\n\r\nCloses NEXT-3312","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65321/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65320","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65320/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65320/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/65320/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65320","id":2277310043,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5udEPU","number":65320,"title":"Upgrade Turbopack","user":{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-05-03T09:42:53Z","updated_at":"2024-05-18T12:01:46Z","closed_at":"2024-05-04T11:18:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/65320","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65320","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65320.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65320.patch","merged_at":"2024-05-04T11:18:09Z"},"body":"\n\n<!-- Thanks for opening a PR!

project attempts. Despite forking it, adding an empty `pages` directory, and relocating the app under src, the setup still didn't replicate the issue accurately.\r\n\r\n1. Migrate Old Pages: Start with a Next.js project that used the traditional `pages` directory. Delete everything inside this directory and switch your project to use the new `app` directory structure.\r\n2. Attempt Intercepting Routes: Implement modal intercept functionality. Despite various attempts and configurations, the interception doesn't work as expected.\r\n3. Remove pages Directory: Eventually, delete the empty `pages` directory entirely. After this change, the route interception starts functioning correctly.\r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure what the exact terms you need to comply in order to reproduce it, but I thought it might be worthwhile raising it, as some other people have seen bizarre effects when it comes to intercepting routes.\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nIntercept modal route not working under some very specific circumstances\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: arm64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 23.1.0: Mon Oct  9 21:28:31 PDT 2023; root:xnu-10002.41.9~6/RELEASE_ARM64_T8112\r\n  Available memory (MB): 8192\r\n  Available CPU cores: 8\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.11.0\r\n  npm: 10.2.4\r\n  Yarn: 4.1.1\r\n  pnpm: N/A\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.3 // Latest available version is detected (14.2.3).\r\n  eslint-config-next: 14.2.3\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?
