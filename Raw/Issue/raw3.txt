`package.json` resolvable. So either they don't have an `exports` field, or their `package.json` is listed in the `exports` field. The React beta types didn't have `package.json` entry in `exports` so we accidentally thought they weren't installed. \r\n\r\nI published [`19.0.0-beta.2` that has `package.json` in `exports`](https://github.com/eps1lon/DefinitelyTyped/pull/31/commits/13879ee571bd3996ad2dffd58a288e9762bf31d1#diff-81cc573aa0c2bd0e13f9463499747741704aabccd7474f544db710befd7bcfc4R44) so we can restore the old behavior. It's still questionable IMO to do all that I/O work just for a nicer error message that may contain false-positive but that's for another time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66128","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66128/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66128/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66128/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66128","id":2312783048,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5wUvIe","number":66128,"title":"Implement `typeof window` inlining for Turbopack","user":{"login":"timneutkens","id":6324199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6324199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens","html_url":"https://github.com/timneutkens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timneutkens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"},{"id":4771244046,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABHGNoDg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/Turbopack","name":"Turbopack","color":"FF1E56","default":false,"description":"Related to Turbopack with Next.js."},{"id":6835761499,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABl3FxWw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-05-23T12:22:25Z","updated_at":"2024-05-26T10:25:41Z","closed_at":"2024-05-26T10:25:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/66128","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66128","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66128.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66128.patch","merged_at":"2024-05-26T10:25:40Z"},"body":"## What?\r\n\r\nUpdate: Implemented a feature in Turbopack for `typeof window` inlining: https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/8211.

Create an endpoint that revalidates paths on demand\r\n2. Call the endpoint to revalidate the path, in our example: \"announcement/announcement-on-behalf-of-amaran-of-not-distributing-dividends-of-2023\"\r\n`import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from \"next\";\r\n\r\nexport default async function handler(\r\n  req: NextApiRequest,\r\n  res: NextApiResponse\r\n) {\r\n  // Check for secret to confirm this is a valid request\r\n  if (req.query.key !== process.env.WORDPRESS_API_KEY) {\r\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: \"Invalid token\" });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const completed: String[] = [];\r\n\r\n  const { body } = req;\r\n\r\n  const { paths } = body;\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n    paths.forEach(async (path: string) => {\r\n      await res.revalidate(path);\r\n\r\n      completed.push(path);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return res.json({ revalidated: true, paths: paths });\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    // If there was an error, Next.js will continue\r\n    // to show the last successfully generated page\r\n    return res\r\n      .status(500)\r\n      .json({ error: true, requested: paths, completed: completed });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n`\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nCurrently statically generated pages does not change at all even the revalidate process seems to be successful. \r\nIt occasionally works but in most cases it doesn't, been spending days on this and really hopping we can find a solution.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: arm64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 23.4.0: Wed Feb 21 21:44:43 PST 2024; root:xnu-10063.101.15~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\r\n  Available memory (MB): 16384\r\n  Available CPU cores: 10\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 21.7.1\r\n  npm: 10.5.0\r\n  Yarn: N/A\r\n  pnpm: N/A\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.2.1 // There is a newer version (14.2.3) available, upgrade recommended! \r\n  eslint-config-next: 14.2.1\r\n  react: 18.2.0\r\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\r\n  typescript: 5.4.5\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\r\n ⚠ There is a newer version (14.2.3) available, upgrade recommended! \r\n   Please try the latest canary version (`npm install next@canary`) to confirm the issue still exists before creating a new issue.\r\n   Read more - https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/opening-an-issue\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

It makes more sense to check the CloseController's `isClosed` instead -- when that becomes `true`, we _really_ shouldn't call onClose anymore (points to a bug), but before that it's fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66097","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66097/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66097/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66097/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66097","id":2311451950,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5wQOO_","number":66097,"title":"Ensure metadata routes dont skip static optimization","user":{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6835761499,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABl3FxWw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2024-05-22T20:46:34Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T12:02:32Z","closed_at":"2024-05-22T21:53:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/66097","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66097","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66097.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66097.patch","merged_at":"2024-05-22T21:53:58Z"},"body":"Follow-up to https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/65825 this ensures we don't skip the static optimization specifically for metadata routes as this most often should be static as they aren't dynamic content and are requested very frequently.

That seems like the only option we have right now for showing things to the user from within Rust. It would be nicer if we could use something structured like `tracing`, but that's not shown to the user.\r\n- Is there some better place to put this check?\r\n- Is the `.next` directory the right place to do this?

\"1\"` message for `/`, so the test will fail.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a race condition: the invalid `revalidate` value is set in a layout, so if `_not-found` happens to be prerendered before `/`, it'll abort the whole prerender (because of `prerenderEarlyExit: true`). so if the timing is right, the test -- which is looking for build errors for `/` -- will never see them and time out.\r\n\r\nThere might be more of these, but unfortunately they're basically race conditions, so I think we'll have to squash them as they come up.\r\n\r\nCC @ijjk

noted in (https://github.com/vercel/nextpack/pull/103), by not having this as a default feature, when running the `build-native` script it's not able to re-use any cargo caches that might already exist from a default build.\r\n\r\nBecause this feature impacts the swc crate, everything dependent on it can be forced to rebuild.\r\n\r\nBy making this a default feature, the hope/theory is that the number of different ways we potentially build our dependency graph reduces, and cargo cache hits will improve.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Add `plugin` to the default set of features for `next-swc-napi`.\r\n- Consolidate `build-native-no-plugin-woa` with `build-native-no-plugin`. Given the lack of any other default features, these are equivalent.\r\n- `i686-pc-windows-msvc`: Switch to `build-native-no-plugin-release` in CI instead of just supplying the `--release` flag. This has the benefit of also enabling `tracing/release_max_level_info`, which might reduce the size of or speed up these builds.\r\n- `x86_64-apple-darwin`: Remove a redundant `--release` flag in the CI config (no expected changes).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've tested this locally on Linux (`pnpm run build-native`) and Windows-on-ARM (`pnpm run build-native-no-plugin`) by making sure things still build. I'll also make sure CI passes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66006/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66004","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66004/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66004/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/66004/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66004","id":2306996264,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC3Cis5wA4d1","number":66004,"title":"[Breaking] Disable automatic fetch caching","user":{"login":"ijjk","id":22380829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgwODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22380829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk","html_url":"https://github.com/ijjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijjk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1965625097,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY1NjI1MDk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/type:%20next","name":"type: next","color":"f6aff7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3129153557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI5MTUzNTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/created-by:%20Next.js%20team","name":"created-by: Next.js team","color":"000000","default":false,"description":"PRs by the Next.js team"},{"id":5721224978,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABVQL3Eg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/locked","name":"locked","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6835761499,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBC3Cis8AAAABl3FxWw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2024-05-20T23:53:47Z","updated_at":"2024-06-07T00:04:22Z","closed_at":"2024-05-23T02:30:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/pulls/66004","html_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66004","diff_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66004.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/66004.patch","merged_at":"2024-05-23T02:30:28Z"},"body":"## Background\r\n\r\nPreviously we introduced automatic caching for `fetch` based on certain heuristics that were a bit tricky to grasp all scenarios. The scenarios we would automatically cache were no dynamic data access before the fetch call e.g. `headers()` or `cookies()`, the fetch call is inside of a dynamic page e.g. `POST` method or `export const revalidate = 0` page and the fetch is a non-`GET` request or has `Authorization` or `Cookie` headers, or the fetch had `cache: 'no-store' | 'no-cache'` or `revalidate: 0`. \r\n\r\n## New Behavior\r\n\r\nBy default fetches will no longer automatically be cached. Instead they need to be opted-in to caching via `export const fetchCache = 'default-cache' | 'force-cache',` `next: { revalidate: false or value > 0 }` or `cache: 'force-cache' | 'default-cache'`. \r\n\r\nWhen the fetch call is automatically skipping the cache it won't impact the page level ISR cacheability although if a fetch call manually specifies `cache: 'no-store'` or `revalidate: 0` it will still bail from the page being statically generated as it was before. \r\n\r\nTo achieve the previous behavior of automatic fetch caching all that needs to be added is `export const fetchCache = 'default-cache'` in the root layout(s) of your project.

@icyJoseph @ztanner\r\n\r\nNOTE: The canary release [`v14.1.1-canary.51`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v14.1.1-canary.51) and below work as expected.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nIntroduced from #61535, the initial prefetch cache is set based on the `location.pathname`.\r\nWhen a page is loaded WITH the search param, the cache key does not contain information of the search param.\r\n\r\nThe issue is when on a dynamic page reading the `searchParams` value, the value doesn't change if navigated as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/?q=foo --> /\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe prefetch cache hits, not re-rendering, and the `searchParams` value is not passed properly.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nFor the prefetch cache, add the `location.search` as well.\r\n\r\nSince `createPrefetchCacheKey` uses [`createHrefFromUrl`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/client/components/router-reducer/create-href-from-url.ts) which includes `location.search`, I'm expecting the change won't affect current cache key behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes #64170\r\nFixes

Open http://localhost:3000/\r\n2. Click on `/products#category-42`\r\n3. Observe `<h2 id=\"category-42\">` inside viewport\r\n4. Go back to `/`\r\n5. Click on `/products-with-suspense#category-42` (same page, but categories load inside Suspense boundary with a 100ms delay)\r\n6. Observe the top of the page, unlike previously\n\n### Current vs. Expected behavior\n\nI’d expect `/products#category-42` and `/products-with-suspense#category-42` to work the same way. If `#category-42` shows while Suspense ‘islands’ get ‘resolved’, a user should be navigated to the hash. Perhaps, it should be smooth in this case (to explain the ‘blink’ of the top of the page), but not having it at all is a bug.\r\n\r\nThis bug can emerge as a regression during refactoring. Imagine we have a product catalog that has been working for years and we’ve added `<Suspense>` around the list of products to show the skeleton of the `/products` page ASAP. Users will no longer be able to navigate to a specific category.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, navigating to  `/products-with-suspense#category-42` for the second time works correctly (i.e. it scrolls like `/products#category-42`). This is because of caching. When browser-side cache of `/products-with-suspense` expires, scrolling is skipped again.\n\n### Provide environment information\n\n```bash\nOperating System:\r\n  Platform: darwin\r\n  Arch: arm64\r\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 23.5.0: Wed May  1 20:12:58 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.121.3~5/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\r\n  Available memory (MB): 32768\r\n  Available CPU cores: 10\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 20.11.1\r\n  npm: 10.5.0\r\n  Yarn: 4.0.0\r\n  pnpm: 8.10.5\r\nRelevant Packages:\r\n  next: 14.3.0-canary.70 // Latest available version is detected (14.3.0-canary.70).\r\n  eslint-config-next: N/A\r\n  react: 19.0.0-beta-04b058868c-20240508\r\n  react-dom: 19.0.0-beta-04b058868c-20240508\r\n  typescript: 5.1.3\r\nNext.js Config:\r\n  output: N/A\n```\n\n\n### Which area(s) are affected?

If you use \"edge\", there will be a build error.\r\n\r\nThis is contrary to the documentation, which states\r\n\r\n> You can explicitly set the runtime on a per-page basis by modifying the config, for example:\r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> // pages/index.js\r\n> export const config = {\r\n>   runtime: 'nodejs', // or \"edge\"\r\n> }\r\n>  \r\n> export const getServerSideProps = async () => {}\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> – [source](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props#edge-runtime)\r\n\r\nThis PR allows \"edge\" to be used as the runtime for Pages Router pages.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nEither the documentation is wrong, or the \"edge\" check should be removed. Since in #50701, the `// or \"edge\"` phrase was explicitly added to that part, I suppose the team decided already to fully stabilise the edge runtime everywhere, so I decided to make the PR to remove the \"edge\" check.\r\n\r\nIf the documentation is wrong and the edge runtime should still be marked as experimental, feel free to close this PR *but* please also update the documentation in that case.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nI simply removed the \"edge\" checks. Using \"experimental-edge\" in pages should now result in a warning but things should still work (same as Edge API Routes).\r\n\r\nFixes
